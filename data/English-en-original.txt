The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI , so this would be like having J. Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s . <eos>
It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam . <eos>
In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain , assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University , was assassinated with his driver in the Salikh district . <eos>
Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday , protesting the killing of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms . <eos>
Al - Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec. 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office . <eos>
Chalabi has been increasingly marginalized within Iraq , however , despite his ties of clientelage with Washington and Tehran . <eos>
Some 2,000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months , something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have . <eos>
In Baghdad the fighting still continues in several areas , mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya . <eos>
My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now , helicopters have been circling over our heads non-stop . <eos>
Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin an Al Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website the voice of Jihad , in which he stated that " although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam , but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions " . <eos>
This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL which contained the following : <eos>
These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military " president " who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al Qaeda . <eos>
If al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers , they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political allies and hosts . <eos>
On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election , and to repeal the contentious " Legal Framework Order " that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship . <eos>
Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan , referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng hui simply as Lee . " <eos>
Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan 's recent coup . <eos>
Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military 's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 's willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger . <eos>
Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military 's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 's willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger . <eos>
Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002 , risking war twice that year . <eos>
This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing " stability " to the region in fall of 1999 . <eos>
Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000 , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified . <eos>
It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel , and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals . <eos>

Israel 's security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors , which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians . <eos>
And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka . <eos>
Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success , and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed - door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track , diplomatic sources said . <eos>

Under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east . <eos>
India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation . <eos>
The Tigers ' chief ideologue , Balasingham , sniffed at the proposal saying that " a solution to the ethnic conflict can not be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences , but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces . " <eos>
And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka . <eos>
But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka 's Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits . <eos>
The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome , except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U.S. State Department and the Pakistan Army , which would like to even the score with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971 . <eos>
It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002 , pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China . <eos>
We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a 60 Minutes II report based largely on forged documents . <eos>
The F - 102 saw service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969 . <eos>
What follows is the text of an e-mail sent to me by a friend of mine ( thanks to Dave Manzano ) . <eos>
That he did n’t show up for duty in Alabama ? <eos>
News coverage of the president ’s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else . <eos>
Requests like that were n’t unusual , says retired Col. William Campenni , who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971 . <eos>
Ahmed Al - Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al - Sha'lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media . <eos>
One remark made by Sha'lan on Al Arabiya TV , that he could n't say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor . <eos>
Many Iraqis , including conservative and religious Iraqis , are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party , probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly . <eos>
I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba'athist old - timer who claimed that Ba'athists have the means to stage a third coup d'etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal . <eos>
Because of such talk , Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials . <eos>
Posada 's crimes , on the other hand , must seem like ancient history , especially to a people who do n't know their history . <eos>
Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell 's whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics . <eos>
Police said Bernard confessed to detectives that he had sex with a young girl in November 2002 and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at Hosanna Church . <eos>
We have a similar case unravelling up here in the northwest with a murder of a family and missing children taken for some purpose . <eos>
Yesterday evening , the Posada story was featured in the public television news show in Germany ( ARD , Tagesthemen ) . <eos>
I do n't know how others feel , but I 'm definitely looking into immigration to Canada as an option . <eos>
Information pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami which took a heavy toll on the Andamans . <eos>
Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new , but they have deteriorated during the past few years , in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh Nepal and Bhutan and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur Nagaland and Tripura . <eos>
While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh . <eos>
Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels secessionists drug runners and arms traffickers , it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations . <eos>
This formidable enemy , which gave the Indian army a black eye in the mid-1980s , has been operating in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time . <eos>
The search - and - destroy operation was carried out by the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo . <eos>
The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in the now defunct Asiaweek in 2001 . <eos>
A shipment of weapons , ammunition and explosives , believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth several million dollars , left the port of Phuket in Thailand in early February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex Joux 3 . <eos>
As is LTTE standard procedure , the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon . <eos>
On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa - based spy planes of India 's Aviation Research Center ; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka 's east coast . <eos>
At the time of his arrest , the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a " submarine " in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast . <eos>
A pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the LTTE from Laos , Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong , from where they are transported northward by land to Bhutan . <eos>
Stretching 750 kilometers from end to end , they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia . <eos>
For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours Pakistan Iran and the Central Asian Republics and regional powers Russia and India . <eos>
‘’ It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis , ’’ says a Western diplomat . <eos>
Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti-Americanism and anti-army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March . <eos>
With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan , Iran ’s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced . <eos>
He was drinking like a fish , every night , into the wee hours . <eos>
He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq . <eos>
This little - noted interview with Blount 's nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on National Public Radio 's All Things Considered on March 30 2004 , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period . <eos>

This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W. Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s . <eos>
That was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery , at his father 's urging . . . <eos>
After he found out from somebody else , Archibald attempted to talk to Mr. Bush about it . <eos>
In fact , he left the house he rented in such disrepair -- with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill . <eos>
And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted by the UN in 2003 for smuggling arms to Liberia , human rights group Amnesty has discovered . <eos>
But Bout 's name is n't likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives , before it sinks like so many others beneath the media 's frothing triviality . <eos>
And of all the people who the county is getting to find a replacement ... is none other than Lee Brown , the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD , who was in office during the murders and the subsequent investigation . <eos>
Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 . <eos>

The Pentagon is bypassing official US intelligence channels and turning to a dangerous and unruly cast of characters in order to create strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack , former and current intelligence officials say ... <eos>
Balance died in 2004 after a fall . ' <eos>
I 'm wary of jumping into this fray without backup , that 's for damn sure . :) <eos>
I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US 's local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two . <eos>
It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation . <eos>
Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation , April , 2004 : <eos>
My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years . <eos>
However , I will touch upon it only in passing . <eos>
These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as the undeclared World War III : <eos>
Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq . <eos>
It is always shown on television in great detail . <eos>
There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures countries and continents . <eos>
Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way . <eos>
It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them . <eos>
A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam 's regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a peace demonstration . <eos>
You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much . <eos>
A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill . <eos>
Mrs. Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level . <eos>

Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ? <eos>
I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation . <eos>
Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union . <eos>
It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism . <eos>
A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 . <eos>
" The Prophet 's guidance , " says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , " was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ... " The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington D.C. and New York City as well as symbolic targets . <eos>
The computer disk was confiscated from him during his arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan and handed over to the Egyptian authorities . <eos>
But if experience is any guide , nothing would stand in the way of Dr. Ayman Zawahiri 's decade - long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described by one confidante to an Egyptian newspaper reporter . <eos>
A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 . <eos>
In October 2001 , did the FBI profilers know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed had on the seized laptop from 1995 that was signed " Khalid Sheik Bojinka " ? <eos>
Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front Moro Front or MILF . <eos>
The CIA has known of Zawahiri 's plans to use anthrax for a half decade . <eos>
In Fall 2004 , MSNBC , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but can not rule out that it was made overseas . <eos>
Many point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary . <eos>
USDA employee Johnelle Bryant first told us , in sensational detail , of Atta 's inquiries about purchasing and retrofitting a cropduster . <eos>
US - trained Malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat met with 9/11 plotters and two hijackers in January 2000 . <eos>
Zacarias Moussaoui , who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested , stayed at Sufaat 's condominium in 2000 when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia . <eos>
As described in US News , a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat , without realizing it , while traveling near Kabul in October 2001 , perceiving him as Filipino . <eos>
Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 upon his return to Malaysia . <eos>
The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003 . <eos>
Her mother Ismat last saw Aafia and her grandchildren before they left in a minicab at the end of March . <eos>
Aafia was on her way with her children to visit and uncle and a friend in Islamabad . <eos>
( His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate Curveball , which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design ) . <eos>
Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters , in addition to various media outlets , because of the appropriations made pursuant to the Leahy Law to military and security forces . <eos>
There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a Star of David and proposing marriage . <eos>
The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington D.C. . <eos>
Abdel Rahman 's son was captured in Quetta Pakistan in mid-February 2003 . <eos>
A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 . <eos>
It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise " in the hearts of green birds . " <eos>
A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used " school " as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence . <eos>
The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004 . <eos>

An additional $ 800 million in emergency funding was added for NASA during the Committee 's consideration of the bill . <eos>
The bill reduces ISS operations by $ 120 million due to the continued reduced capability of the ISS for at least half of FY05 . <eos>

The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan . <eos>
The submarine incident was put down to a technical error by the Chinese government which apologised to Japan . <eos>
In September , China threatened to veto any move to impose sanctions on Sudan over the atrocities in Darfur . <eos>
But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades , so has its demand for energy . <eos>
Shortages are already leading to power cuts in the big cities . <eos>
Since President Hu ordered state - owned oil firms to " go abroad " to ensure supply , they have begun drilling for gas in the East China Sea , just west of the line that Japan regards as its border . <eos>

But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress not to the President . <eos>
Some strategies being used by NASA & Company in relation to China and other space planning countries are mentioned here after being gleaned from a news item underneath . <eos>
The target for NASA & Company probably to get by 2018 all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model , through the propaganda of another moon mission ; deliberately failing this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax ; achieving the real aim of space unity between space programs of other countries . <eos>
A pair of military pilots embarked on China 's second manned space flight early today , hurtling into orbit on a test mission that could span five days . <eos>
The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified as Fei Junlong 40 and Nie Haishen 41 , by China 's official news agency . <eos>
But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States to the moon in its secretive space effort . <eos>
China 's overtures to join the U.S. - led effort to develop the 16 - nation international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues including the Asian country 's human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat . <eos>
China was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to NASA - sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush 's strategy to reach the moon with astronauts as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other deep space destinations . <eos>
At least one expert believes China 's intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before NASA 's planned lunar return . <eos>
During the U.S. and Russian lunar race during the Cold War , NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays . <eos>
" They would get in line in front of the Russians . <eos>
Recently , I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires , so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes . <eos>

The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 . <eos>
Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal 's status from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove it from the endangered species list altogether . <eos>

The highly coloured lithograph of the Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly , in the light of one candle , at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations . <eos>
Looking out of the window , Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town , nor yet the buildings near the harbour ; and there was not a sound , as if the tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf , spreading from the waters over the land , had made it dumb as well as blind . . . . <eos>
It came from Liverpool , that was the port base to the Titanic , destroyed by God because of the arrogant insult of captain Smith also from Liverpool : " Not even God can sink my ship " ( not only the captain , but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the Titanic were from Liverpool ) . <eos>
Some months later Sutcliffe died from brain haemorrhage because of John Lennon 's bruises . <eos>
The same demons that made captain Smith say " Not even God can sink my ship " spoke from antichrist John Lennon from Liverpool base port to the Titanic saying : " Christianity is on the go . <eos>
At the same time , the devil acted through his other main puppets with Sympathy for the devil that was when the pact of the Rolling Stones with Satan took the life of the founder of the group , the guitarist Brian Jones ( who refused to be a puppet of the devil ) , murdered by people sent by Mick Jagger , another assassin . <eos>
Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ , and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ together with Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming " Peace " , being then when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of " The ballad of John and Yoko " : " the way things are going , they 're going to crucify me ... " , The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the " Rolling Stone " magazine ( today condensed in the " Lennon remembers " book ) where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming " whatever is up there " for it ( referring to God ) . <eos>
After George Harrison , said arrogantly in a video filmed in his studio at Henley on Thames : " I want to talk about the divinity of man " , he was given throat cancer by GOD because of those words , which made metastasis and carried on to final death .. <eos>
To Paul McCartney whose company 's logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god , and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that he was made Sir when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir as long as he produces money for the nation , GOD provided cancer to the wife . <eos>
At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills , he used Linda 's death for promotional ends , due to his waning popularity . <eos>
Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot , but he did n't say that it was because he felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same , even though it has never been much . <eos>
It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings : " I 've got a feeling , a feeling I ca n't hide ... " in front of Yoko in the film . <eos>
The Beatles are very well known by people close to them for their arrogance and racism . <eos>
That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios during the filming of Let it Be . <eos>
When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : " ah !! .. in Sweden .. " , as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike . <eos>
The newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of George 's house ( Friar Park ) refers to him as an overbearing person to stay away from . <eos>
It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him . <eos>
Is the old Devil attempting to disguise as good in front of people . <eos>
After the Devil began his devastating job from the ghostly Devil 's Island through his nine main puppets Beatles Rolling Stones , he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned Island and weakening their conscience with drugs , he made them proclaimers of homosexuality , aversion to religion , destruction of family values , dissipation , mental illness , antisocialism , etc. , etc. , <eos>
This mentally ill humanity , destroyed families , twisted moral values , manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings , anti natural feminism rebellion , drug addiction , corrupt social outlines , mad youths without direction , non respect to hierarchies , convulsed nations , misanthropy , misogyny , paedophilia , irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations , are due to the vast manoeuvre that Satan executed through his main marionettes the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , from the Devil 's Island . <eos>
If the US attacks Iran , it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi'ite factions loyal to Iran . <eos>

You can not set the SQL query mode new database default to ANSI-92 in 2000 file format because the option is disabled ; <eos>
This provides a way of transforming an XML document 's presentation information from a source format to a target format and back again . <eos>
Typically , a developer creates an XSL transformation file that , when applied to an XML document during export , interprets or transforms the XML data into a presentation format that can be recognized by another application , such as Service Advertising Protocol ( SAP ) or a custom purchase order format . <eos>

An hour later , as he climbed from the number 4 bus at 70th Street and Fifth Avenue , he still had not answered the question . <eos>
He thought for a moment of Vermeer 's Soldier and Young Girl Smiling trying to remember the expression on the girl 's face , the exact position of her hands around the cup , the red back of the faceless man . <eos>
He 's been waiting for you since eight o'clock . <eos>
He had wanted to take in the details of what he was seeing , but the task was somehow beyond him at that moment . <eos>
The apartment loomed up around him as a kind of blur . <eos>
No more than a general impression – even though he was there , looking at those things with his own eyes . <eos>
He found himself sitting on a sofa , alone in the living room . <eos>
The act of moving from one place to another seemed to require all his attention , as though not to think of what he was doing would reduce him to immobility . <eos>
It seemed to Quinn that Stillman 's body had not been used for a long time and that all its functions had been relearned , so that motion had become a conscious process , each movement broken down into its component submovements , with the result that all flow and spontaneity had been lost . <eos>
As the car rattled through the park toward the West Side , Quinn looked out the window and wondered if these were the same trees that Peter Stillman saw when he walked out into the air and the light . <eos>
Occasionally , after poring over an object in this way , Stillman would toss it back onto the sidewalk . But more often than not he would open his bag and lay the object gently inside it . <eos>
Twice , when his scavenging haul had been unusually large , he returned to the hotel in the middle of the day and remerged a few minutes later with an empty bag . <eos>

When darkness came , Stillman would eat dinner at the Apollo Coffee Shop on 97th Street and Broadway and then return to his hotel for the night . <eos>
If this interpretation required knowledge on Stillman 's part , then Quinn would accept this knowledge as an article of faith , at least for the time being . <eos>
Quinn could walk through the streets every day for the rest of his life , and still he would not find him . <eos>
Quinn backtracked in his mind to the beginning of the case . <eos>
For two weeks he had been tied by an invisible thread to the old man . <eos>
It was a well-kept place , with polished doorknobs and clean glass , and it had an air of bourgeois sobriety that appealed to Quinn at that moment . <eos>
Auster 's apartment was on the eleventh floor , and Quinn rang the buzzer , expecting to hear a voice speak to him through the intercom . <eos>
Just as he opened his mouth to speak , he was interrupted by a clattering of keys at the front door , the sound of the door opening and then slamming shut , and a burst of voices . <eos>
A moment later he heard the child running towards him down the hall . The child shot into the living room , caught sight of Quinn , and stopped dead in his tracks . <eos>
He prayed to himself for deliverance . <eos>
And around and around it goes , shouted the boy , suddenly spreading his arms and spinning around the room like a gyroscope . <eos>
The Mets matched that run in their half of the inning on a double by Wilson and a single by Youngblood . <eos>

One of these papers , written by Eichelberger himself , was translated into Arabic , " commented upon by members of Nasser 's staff , translated back into English for Eichelberger 's benefit . " <eos>
This document , called " Power Problems of a Revolutionary Government , " went back-and-forth according to Mr Copeland between English and Arabic until a final version was produced . <eos>

On the pilot 's advice they were moved farther into port by two tugs . <eos>
True , the ship had had to be moved into its berth by the tugs but it had been crippled only briefly . <eos>

The subject of all this talk is , ultimately , survival the survival of the decent society created in Israel within a few decades . <eos>
You are in a city like many another well , not quite , for Jerusalem is the only ancient city I 've ever seen whose antiquities are not on display as relics but are in daily use . <eos>

The Nellie , a cruising yawl , swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails , and was at rest . <eos>
The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway . <eos>
And at last , in its curved and imperceptible fall , the sun sank low , and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat , as if about to go out suddenly , stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men . <eos>
The old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day , after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks , spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth . <eos>
We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever but in the august light of abiding memories . <eos>
What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth ! ... <eos>
Imagine the feelings of a commander of a fine – what 'd 'ye call 'em ? – trireme in the Mediterranean , ordered suddenly to the north ; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry ; put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries , – a wonderful lot of handy men they must have been too – used to build , apparently by the hundred , in a month or two , if we may believe what we read . <eos>

Imagine him here – the very end of the world , a sea the color of lead , a sky the color of smoke , a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina – and going up this river with stores or orders or what you like . <eos>
Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness like a needle in a bundle of hay cold , fog , tempests , disease , exile , and death , – death skulking in the air , in the water , in the bush . <eos>
The traffic of the great city went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river . <eos>
yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I got out there , what I saw , how I went up that river to the place where I first met the poor chap . <eos>
I had then , as you remember , just returned to London after a lot of Indian Ocean Pacific China Seas a regular dose of the East six years or so and I was loafing about , hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes , just as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilize you . <eos>
It had got filled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names . <eos>
And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window , it fascinated me as a snake would a bird – a silly little bird . <eos>

I left in a French steamer , and she called in every blamed port they have out there for as far as I could see the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom-house officers . <eos>
The edge of a colossal jungle , so dark-green as to be almost black , fringed with white surf , ran straight like a ruled line far far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist . <eos>
Here and there grayish-whitish specks showed up , clustered inside the white surf , with a flag flying above them perhaps . <eos>
We gave her her letters ( I heard the men in that lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three a day ) and went on . <eos>
We called at some more places with farcical names where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf as if Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders in and out of rivers streams of death in life whose banks were rotting into mud whose waters thickened into slime invaded the contorted mangroves that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair <eos>

A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare . <eos>
It turned aside for the bowlders , and also for an undersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air . <eos>
He had a uniform jacket with one button off , and seeing a white man on the path , hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity . <eos>
He was speedily reassured , and with a large , white , rascally grin , and a glance at his charge , seemed to take me into partnership in his exalted trust . <eos>
My purpose was to stroll into the shade for a moment ; but no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped into a gloomy circle of some Inferno . <eos>
They had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board , in charge of some volunteer skipper , and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of her on stones , and she sank near the south bank . <eos>
It came at the end of his speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable . <eos>
When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence , he ordered an immense round table to be made , for which a special house had to be built . <eos>
I interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr. Kurtz on the coast . <eos>

She used to make packages of sandwiches for Mweta to take with him when he cycled for miles about Gala province at weekends , speaking at meetings . <eos>
They were standing at the door of Mweta 's taxi ; there was a sudden uprush of feeling between the two men ; the Englishman stood there , the small , quick black man took him by the biceps , hard , through his dark suit , as in his own country he would have linked fingers with a brother . <eos>
They had laid flag-stones under the walnut trees for the white wooden chairs and table , so that it would n't be too damp . <eos>
Sometimes before the dusk wavered the wood away into the distance , he went out into the sunlight that collected like golden water in the dip of the meadows and shot a partridge . <eos>
And so the question of what they were talking about really amounted to her hidden , pressed-down , banked-over desire to know whether this house , this life in Wiltshire , this life – at last – seemed to him the definitive one in the end . <eos>
White people given appointments in African countries after independence were usually employed on contract . <eos>
When the sun rose some slumped off into sleep , but women began to examine the plastic bags in which they kept their hats , and , as the hard beams of the sun struck into the cabin and as the hard beams of the sun struck into the cabin on hairnets pale lips and stubble queues formed for the lavatories . <eos>
He unhooked his safety belt and leaned over to look at an angle through the bleary lens on the far side of the aisle ; and there it was , tiny and distorted and real , bush , earth , exactly as it remained in his mind always , without his thinking about it . <eos>
A black man in khaki shorts ( used to be a white man in white stockings ) sprayed a cloyingly perfumed insecticide over the passengers ' heads as a precaution against the plane harbouring mosquitoes and tsetse flies . <eos>
The doors opened ; voices from without came in on currents of air ; he emerged among the others into heady recognition taken in at all the senses , walking steadily across the tarmac through the raw-potato whiff of the undergrowth , the fresh , early warmth on hands , the cool metallic taste of last night 's storm at the back of the throat , <eos>

He knew no one but the walk was processional , a reception to him , and by the time he entered the building over the steps where , as always , dead insects fallen from the light during the night had not been swept away , it was all as suddenly familiar and ordinary as the faces other people were greeting were , to them . <eos>
We 'll go in and have a steak there one evening , they 're trying to make a go of it with a charcoal grill and whatnot . <eos>
The spiders came out from behind the pictures and flattened like starfish against the walls . <eos>
Festus could be heard retailing the exchange , confidently in the right in the kitchen ; <eos>
He ate a mouthful of the left-over granadilla pudding , and there was the smallest tremor , passing for a moment through his head . <eos>
What if he brought the whole Lambala-speaking crowd out in a boycott with all the old beatingsup at the polls hut burnings you think I would n't find myself the one to put Shinza inside this time <eos>
A furry black band of ants led up a cupboard door to some scrap that had flicked from a plate . <eos>
He stood at the sink , drinking cold water and looking at the avocado pear pip growing suspended by three matchsticks in the neck of a pickle jar of water on the sill . <eos>
He heard Dando , forced by the old Labrador into the garden , walking about outside the guest hut and talking reproachfully to the dog ; <eos>
and then it was morning and Festus 's assistant was at the door with the early tea . <eos>
There was a moment in the stadium at the actual Independence ceremony when he heard it on the perimeter of the sky just as Kenyatta began to speak , and he and Vivien Bayley , the young wife of the registrar of the new university , sitting beside him , collided glances of alert apprehension ... <eos>
Later it was discovered to have been giving flips at half-a-crown a time to a section of the population who were queueing up all through the ceremony at the nearby soccer field ; <eos>

Bray surprised her by asking her to dance , swaying stiffly to a rhythm he did n't know , but nevertheless keeping the beat , so that they would n't make fools of themselves among the complicated gyrations of the Africans . <eos>
being accepted with such immediate casual friendliness by everyone was rather like being forced to learn a foreign language by finding oneself alone among people who spoke nothing else : <eos>
Someone called to Vivien and they were drawn away from the dancers to a crowded table . <eos>
I wonder how much use could be made of a radio classroom in country schools , whether it could n't help considerably to ease the shortage of teachers , here , and maintain some sort of standard where teachers are perhaps not very well qualified . <eos>
I 'd like to talk to somebody about it ... your man ? <eos>
Bright hair was brushed up off a high round forehead and behind the ears , in a way he associated with busy capable women . <eos>
Margot 's had to be in the kitchen herself from six in the morning , and some nights it 's been until ten . <eos>
The cook went to the Independence ceremony and we have n't seen him since ... just for the afternoon he said just to see the great men he 's seen in the papers well what can you say <eos>
Everyone knows you must be crazy to come of your own free will to one of these countries . <eos>
There was a group in loud discussion round the empty fireplace where the beer bottles were stacked ... <eos>
banging on the Governor 's door with a panga when the others were still picannins with snotty noses ... <eos>
Oh you make the usual mistake of seeing the life of the African people as a blank ... and then the colonialists come along and we come to life in your compounds and back yards <eos>
But if you have to do it by keeping that forty years or whatever sitting at the table with you and your children ... ach , it 's not healthy , it makes me sick . <eos>
Evelyn Odara spoke to her husband as no local woman would dare ; yet he ignored it , as if turning the tables on her with his countrymen 's assumption that what women said was not heard anyway <eos>
He said angrily to Wentz , directing the remark at the wife through the husband , What did you get in return that was worth it ? <eos>
She said , There 're bulbs like you see in films round the star 's dressing-table , and they light up and spell INDEPENDENCE HURRAH . <eos>
They went all the way back into town to the flats where the Edwards girl lived ... <eos>
Neil stood on the moonlit patch of earth in front of the dark building and called up , but there was no response . <eos>
He answered Neil with a liberal use of Bwana , as a white man would expect if he were to do such a thing as stop for a black one on the road , and when he got into the car beside Bray and the South African , sat among these black and white city people like a hedgehog rolled into itself at a touch . <eos>

they passed the shadows of the mango trees in the bright moonlight lying beneath the trees like sleeping beasts ; <eos>
a donkey cropping among broken china on a refuse mound ; <eos>
Not for the first time , an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four Privet Drive . <eos>
Mr Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud hooting noise from his nephew Harry 's room . <eos>
Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet . <eos>
All Harry 's spellbooks , his wand , robes , cauldron and top-of-the-range Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home . <eos>
What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done ? <eos>
He 'd been talking of nothing else for a fortnight . <eos>
Now , we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner . <eos>
When dinner 's over , you take Mrs Mason back to the lounge for coffee , Petunia , and I 'll bring the subject round to drills . <eos>
Countless times , Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig 's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter , but it was n't worth the risk . <eos>
Harry had n't told the Dursleys this ; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick . <eos>
What would n't he give now for a message from Hogwarts ? <eos>
Harry had slipped through Voldemort 's clutches for a second time , but it had been a narrow escape , and even now , weeks later , Harry kept waking in the night , drenched in cold sweat , wondering where Voldemort was now , remembering his livid face , his wide , mad eyes . <eos>
As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt , Aunt Petunia knew he had n't really done magic , but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan . <eos>
Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe , slipped inside , closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed . <eos>
Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and leg holes . <eos>
Th-thank you , said Harry , edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair next to Hedwig who was asleep in her large cage . <eos>
People goggled through the bars at him as he lay , starving and weak , on a bed of straw . <eos>
And someone was goggling through the bars at him : a freckle-faced , red-haired , long-nosed someone . <eos>
Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George , Ron 's elder twin brothers . <eos>
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry 's window . <eos>
Fred and George climbed carefully through the window into Harry 's room . <eos>
Harry dashed around his room , collecting his things together and passing them out of the window to Ron . <eos>
At last , panting , they reached the landing , then carried the trunk through Harry 's room to the open window . <eos>
Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car . <eos>
The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat , grinning from ear to ear . <eos>
George handed the hairpin to Ron and a moment later , Hedwig had soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost . <eos>
They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron 's house . <eos>
Mrs Weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips , staring from one guilty face to the next . <eos>

Just last night we were saying we 'd come and get you ourselves if you had n't written back to Ron by Friday . <eos>
Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words : Gilderoy Lockhart 's Guide to Household Pests . <eos>
He supposed he had n't spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys fire . <eos>
Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight . <eos>
Mrs Weasley and Ginny were going to a second-hand robe shop . Mr Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink . <eos>
Grandmother was here , wrapped from head to foot in woollens , her face entirely obscured by a seaman 's balaclava . <eos>
I think I was happy , in the maddening determined way that children have of being happy , and it was that happiness that worked as a magnet on both of my parents . <eos>
Her kitchen had strings of onions and fat hams hanging in glorious torture from twisted hooks in the ceiling . <eos>
She smoked her own kippers up the chimney , skewering them in pairs with discarded knitting needles . <eos>
At that second the car was rocked on every side by thousands of screaming girls . <eos>
I saw their faces streaked with tears pressed in agony against the windows and windscreen of the car . <eos>
As I came through the back door into her kitchen she frisked me from head to foot , removed the disinfectant and gave me a pair of overalls to wear . <eos>
I persuaded my parents to let me go and stay with my grandmother on party nights . <eos>
And he would stare at me in that way of his , trying to see happiness the way he could see a business opportunity . <eos>
Poor baby , passed from hand to hand like a pouch of tobacco a fresh-faced narcotic promising hope change at least for now . <eos>
She made me stand in the corner of the kitchen behind the memorial oilskin , while she wheezed and whirred something out of the coal-hole . <eos>
I could hear a crackling and a scratching and what sounded like fluff on the end of a record-player needle . <eos>
My grandmother got down a pair of kippers and broiled them for us in butter and water . <eos>
He wanted to go with them to the filthy Admiral Arms but what right had he to sit in his cups when they would be going home to cheap rations and unpaid bills ? <eos>
On the sixth day of his absence my mother appeared in the dining room in her mink coat carrying a small suitcase . <eos>
The three of us were doing a jigsaw while the inadequate fire tried to melt the icicles that were hanging in long spears around the room . <eos>
He had started at the end of the war as an office boy and fourteen years later was to be made a director of the line . <eos>
She threw me in the back seat and flung herself in after me in a whirl of Dior and hairpins . <eos>
Behind them , a taxi-driver struggled up the steps with a pile of boxes . <eos>
The little boy had been asleep and through his dreams came a sleigh piled with furs and followed on foot by a band of wild dark men huddled hurrying talking in a language he did not understand . <eos>
She took me home , did n't put on any lights , took off her clothes and had me lie down beside her on what seemed to be a very narrow bed . <eos>
I enjoyed looking at her in a way that was forbidden to me , this self on self , self as desirer and desired , had a frankness to it I had not been invited to discover . <eos>
There was nothing left in the room but she and me , she and me hypnotised by each other , unable to speak because of the wind . <eos>
I moved in black knight right angles across and cross the lines but apart from a few appreciative businessmen there was no one who seemed interested in me . <eos>

We know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part - session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings . <eos>

Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today 's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past ? <eos>
In any event , this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday . <eos>
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission 's political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi , who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech . <eos>
Madam President , in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group . <eos>
As an Austrian , I still have a vivid memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense . <eos>
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit . <eos>
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards . <eos>
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible . <eos>
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems . <eos>
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so in this Parliament and rightly so . <eos>
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods . <eos>
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force on 1 January 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN , that is the European committee for standardisation . <eos>

In so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure . <eos>
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this Directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it . <eos>
A moment ago , Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures not of 20 degrees below zero but of 40 degrees below zero . <eos>
Mr President , it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament namely Wales . <eos>
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17 . <eos>
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing . <eos>
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air . <eos>
In our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , in the best and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are when all is said and done the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing . <eos>
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today . <eos>
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future . <eos>
The implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service . <eos>
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 - 2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission 's offices for several months . <eos>
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part - session . <eos>
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part session . <eos>
Mr President , on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues . <eos>
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the Regulation in the form of an annex as we and Mrs Mccarthy , as rapporteurs for the general Regulation , had asked . <eos>

LONDON – Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised his audience at a conference late last year by speculating that banking assets in London could grow to more than nine times Britain 's GDP by 2050 . <eos>
But it is clear that financial firms compete with others for resources and especially for skilled labor . <eos>
So , should Britons look forward with enthusiasm to the future sketched by Carney ? <eos>

Was Schauble 's statement supposed to serve as a rallying cry for greater European solidarity ? <eos>
In 1760 the elder Balzac set off for Paris with only a louis coin in his pocket determined to improve his social standing ; <eos>
Balzac 's mother , born Anne - Charlotte - Laure Sallambier , came from a family of haberdashers in Paris . <eos>
When the Balzac children returned home , they were kept at a frigid distance by their parents , which affected the author - to - be significantly . <eos>
Balzac worked these scenes from his boyhood - as he did many aspects of his life and the lives of those around him - into La Comédie Humaine . <eos>
In 1814 the Balzac family moved to Paris , and Honoré was sent to private tutors and schools for the next two and a half years . <eos>
Instead , in April 1819 he was allowed to live in the French capital - as English critic George Saintsbury describes it - in a garret furnished in the most Spartan fashion with a starvation allowance and an old woman to look after him , while the rest of the family moved to a house twenty miles [ 32 km ] outside Paris . <eos>

" Although he originally called it Etudes des Mœurs ( Study of Mores ) , it eventually became known as La Comédie Humaine , and he included in it all the fiction that he had published in his lifetime under his own name . <eos>
After the collapse of his businesses , Balzac traveled to Brittany and stayed with the De Pommereul family outside Fougères . <eos>
It established him as an author of note ( even if the surface owes a debt to Walter Scott ) and provided him with a name outside his past pseudonyms . <eos>
He is trapped by the Abbé Herrera Vautrin in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status . <eos>
The conniving and wrangling over wills and inheritances reflect the expertise gained by the author as a young law clerk . <eos>
He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch ; <eos>
he claimed to have once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle . <eos>
In Balzac Ewelina found a kindred spirit for her emotional and social desires , with the added benefit of feeling a connection to the glamorous capital of France . <eos>
Competing with the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt , Balzac visited her in St. Petersburg in 1843 and impressed himself on her heart . <eos>
On 14 March 1850 , with Balzac 's health in serious decline , they drove from her estate in Wierzchownia village of Verkhivnia to a church in Berdyczów city of Berdychiv today in Ukraine and were married . <eos>
Saintsbury points out that " Cœlebs can not talk of marriage with much authority . <eos>
They arrived in the French capital on 20 May his fifty first birthday . <eos>
He had been visited that day by Victor Hugo , who later served as pallbearer and eulogist at Balzac 's funeral . <eos>
Balzac was buried at the Cimetière du Père Lachaise in Paris . <eos>
In 1878 James wrote with sadness about the lack of contemporary attention paid to Balzac and lavished praise on him in four essays in 1875 1877 1902 and 1913 . <eos>
William Shakespeare ( 26 April 1564 ( baptised ) – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's pre-eminent dramatist . <eos>
Between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor writer and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men later known as the King 's Men . <eos>
His early plays were mainly comedies and histories , genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the 16 th century . <eos>
Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime . <eos>
His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world . <eos>
Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered in 1553 , about a quarter mile from his home . <eos>
Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era , but grammar school curricula were largely similar , the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors . <eos>
Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596 . <eos>
After the birth of the twins , Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592 . <eos>
Some 20 th - century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire a Catholic landowner who named a certain William Shakeshafte in his will . <eos>
Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene 's remarks . <eos>
Some of Shakespeare 's plays were published in quarto editions from 1594 . <eos>
Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright . <eos>
The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson 's Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man In His Humour 1598 and Sejanus His Fall 1603 . <eos>
The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson 's Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end . <eos>
Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford during his career . <eos>
He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599 , the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there . <eos>
in an answer to the sharers ' petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans , the King 's Men ' placed men players ' there , ' which were Heminges , Condell , Shakespeare , etc. ' . <eos>
In a document dated 7 June 1609 in a lawsuit he brought in Stratford against John Addenbrooke , Shakespeare is described as ' generosus nuper in curia domini Jacobi ' ( ' gentleman , recently at the Court of King James ' ) . <eos>
However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609 . <eos>
After 1610 , Shakespeare wrote fewer plays , and none are attributed to him after 1613 . <eos>
Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets ' Corner in Westminster Abbey . <eos>
Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same , mostly early and late in his career . <eos>
Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised by other writers after their original composition . <eos>
The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI , written in the early 1590 s during a vogue for historical drama . <eos>
Shakespeare 's early classical and Italianate comedies , containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences , give way in the Mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies . <eos>
Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare 's part , but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day . <eos>
When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord , they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre , the first playhouse built by actors for actors , on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark . <eos>

Although the performance records are patchy , the King 's Men performed seven of Shakespeare 's plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605 , including two performances of The Merchant of Venice . <eos>
After 1608 , they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer . <eos>
The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing , among other characters . <eos>
He was replaced around the turn of the 16 th century by Robert Armin who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear . <eos>
A third narrative poem , A Lover 's Complaint , in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor , was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609 . <eos>
Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed , but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership . <eos>
Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599 , Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare 's " sugred Sonnets among his private friends " . <eos>

The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self declaration of Vice in medieval drama . <eos>
It is often beautiful , but its sentences tend to start , pause , and finish at the end of lines , with the risk of monotony . <eos>
This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation , cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama . <eos>
Until Romeo and Juliet , for example , romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy . <eos>
The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology , in particular that of Hamlet , for his theories of human nature . <eos>
In 1598 , the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English writers as the most excellent in both comedy and tragedy . <eos>
but during the 18 th century , critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius . <eos>
The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale . <eos>
The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by John Shakespeare , found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street . <eos>
Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare 's Catholicism in his plays , but the truth may be impossible to prove either way . <eos>
