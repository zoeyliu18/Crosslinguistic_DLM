The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI , so this would be like having J. Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ back in the 1960s members of the Weathermen bombers at a high level . <eos>
It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working in Vietnam for the other side . <eos>
In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain , assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University , was assassinated in the Salikh district with his driver . <eos>
Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated on Friday in Baghdad , protesting the killing of their clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons , by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms . <eos>
Al - Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office on party lists in the Dec. 15 elections . <eos>
Chalabi has been increasingly marginalized despite his ties of clientelage with Washington and Tehran , however , within Iraq . <eos>
Some 2,000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled in recent months to duty , something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have . <eos>
In Baghdad the fighting still continues mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya , in several areas . <eos>
My neighbourhood has been surrounded for three days by American troops now , helicopters have been circling over our heads non-stop . <eos>
Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed on an Islamic website the voice of Jihad by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin an Al Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia , in which he stated that " although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam , but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions " . <eos>
This was heavily promoted in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL which contained the following by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society : <eos>
These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military " president " who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot against the Taliban and al Qaeda with the United States . <eos>
If al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers , they can hope to catapult the MMA as political allies and hosts to power . <eos>
On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run in a fair election for president , and to repeal the contentious " Legal Framework Order " that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship . <eos>
Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan , referring simply as Lee to Taiwanese President Lee Teng hui . " <eos>
Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush for his comments on Pakistan 's recent coup to task . <eos>
Musharraf made his coup because of the military 's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 's willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir in part , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger . <eos>
Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military 's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 's willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came as a warmonger to power . <eos>
Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship in 2002 with India , risking war twice that year . <eos>
This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing " stability " in fall of 1999 to the region . <eos>
Although Israel withdrew in May 2000 from Lebanese territory , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified . <eos>
It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side against Israel with their Hizbullah coreligionists , and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals . <eos>

Israel 's security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors , which can only be achieved by trading land with the Palestinians for peace . <eos>
And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka by the LTTE . <eos>
Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran without success in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi , and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed - door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track , diplomatic sources said . <eos>

Under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed in the north and east as peacekeepers . <eos>
India had to pull back its forces in 1989 from Sri Lanka following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation . <eos>
The Tigers ' chief ideologue , Balasingham , sniffed at the proposal saying that " a solution to the ethnic conflict can not be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences , but has to be negotiated without the constraints of external forces by the parties in conflict . " <eos>
And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka by the LTTE . <eos>
But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated by the narrow Palk Straits from Sri Lanka 's Jaffna peninsula . <eos>
The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome , except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U.S. State Department and the Pakistan Army , which would like to even the score for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971 with India . <eos>
It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in 2002 in an empty bout of saber rattling , pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China . <eos>
We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard based largely on forged documents on a 60 Minutes II report . <eos>
The F - 102 saw service between March 1962 and December 1969 in the Vietnam theater . <eos>
What follows is the text of an e-mail sent by a friend of mine to me ( thanks to Dave Manzano ) . <eos>
That he did n’t show up in Alabama for duty ? <eos>
News coverage of the president ’s years in the Guard has tended to focus to the exclusion of virtually everything else — on one brief portion of that time . <eos>
Requests like that were n’t unusual , says retired Col. William Campenni , who flew in 1970 and 1971 with Bush . <eos>
Ahmed Al - Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al - Sha'lan have been engaging over the media in shrill public attacks . <eos>
One remark made on Al Arabiya TV by Sha'lan , that he could n't say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor . <eos>
Many Iraqis , including conservative and religious Iraqis , are surprisingly rooting probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly , for the Iraqi Communist party . <eos>
I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba'athist old - timer who claimed that Ba'athists have the means to stage a third coup d'etat and return within 10 hours of an American withdrawal to power . <eos>
Because of such talk , Posada has been taken by Immigration officials into custody . <eos>
Posada 's crimes , on the other hand , must seem especially to a people who do n't know their history , like ancient history . <eos>
Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell 's whistleblowing was stifled in his book Cocaine Politics by them . <eos>
Police said Bernard confessed to detectives that he had sex in November 2002 with a young girl and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at Hosanna Church . <eos>
We have a similar case unravelling up here with a murder of a family and missing children taken for some purpose in the northwest . <eos>
Yesterday evening , the Posada story was featured in Germany in the public television news show ( ARD , Tagesthemen ) . <eos>
I do n't know how others feel , but I 'm definitely looking as an option into immigration to Canada . <eos>
Information pointing in this direction came after the December 26 tsunami which took a heavy toll on the Andamans to light . <eos>
Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new , but they have deteriorated in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh Nepal and Bhutan and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur Nagaland and Tripura , during the past few years . <eos>
While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating through Bangladesh between Southeast Asia and northeastern India . <eos>
Unless New Delhi does better in providing security against rebels secessionists drug runners and arms traffickers to its own nationals , it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations . <eos>
This formidable enemy , which gave the Indian army a black eye in the mid-1980s , has been operating for a long time in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea . <eos>
The search - and - destroy operation was carried out after repeated requests from Colombo by the Indian government . <eos>
The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in 2001 in the now defunct Asiaweek . <eos>
A shipment of weapons , ammunition and explosives , believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth several million dollars , left the port of Phuket in Thailand aboard the freighter Comex Joux 3 in early February 2001 . <eos>
As is LTTE standard procedure , the vessel changed its name to Horizon at sea . <eos>
On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa - based spy planes of India 's Aviation Research Center ; it was intercepted off Sri Lanka 's east coast by Indian naval vessels . <eos>
At the time of his arrest , the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a " submarine " on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast in a shipyard . <eos>
A pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the LTTE from Laos , Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong , from where they are transported northward to Bhutan by land . <eos>
Stretching 750 kilometers to end from end , they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia . <eos>
For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from its neighbours Pakistan Iran and the Central Asian Republics and regional powers Russia and India from constant interference . <eos>
‘’ It was the first time that Bush totally focused with the Pakistanis on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda , ’’ says a Western diplomat . <eos>
Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti-Americanism and anti-army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed since March in the region . <eos>
With the US military presence posing a threat in both Iraq and Afghanistan on their borders , Iran ’s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced . <eos>
He was drinking into the wee hours , every night , like a fish . <eos>
He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people in Iraq on a large scale . <eos>
This little - noted interview with Blount 's nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on March 30 2004 on National Public Radio 's All Things Considered , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period . <eos>
This little - noted interview with Blount 's nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on National Public Radio 's " All Things Considered on March 30 , 2004 , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer in that period through Bush . <eos>
This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W. Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard in the early 1970s as a young lieutenant . <eos>
That was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush came at his father 's urging , to Montgomery . . . <eos>
After he found out from somebody else , Archibald attempted to talk about it to Mr. Bush . <eos>
In fact , he left the house he rented with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- in such disrepair -- that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill . <eos>
And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted in 2003 by the UN for smuggling arms to Liberia , human rights group Amnesty has discovered . <eos>
But Bout 's name is n't likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives , before it sinks beneath the media 's frothing triviality like so many others . <eos>
And of all the people who the county is getting to find a replacement ... is none other than Lee Brown , the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD , who was during the murders and the subsequent investigation in office . <eos>
Small polygamous groups have existed under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities in the southwestern US ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 . <eos>

Balance died after a fall in 2004 . ' <eos>
I 'm wary of jumping without backup into this fray , that 's for damn sure . :) <eos>
I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found by one of the US 's local stooges there in storage and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two . <eos>
It is the text of a speech given before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation by an Arab gentleman . <eos>
Talk delivered at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation by Haim Harari , April , 2004 : <eos>
My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived for almost 200 years in this region . <eos>
However , I will touch only in passing upon it . <eos>
These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer as the undeclared World War III to it : <eos>
Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died since the Coalition occupation of Iraq from suicide murders . <eos>
It is always shown in great detail on television . <eos>
There are numerous desperate people in different cultures countries and continents , in the world . <eos>
Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in a big way in Europe . <eos>
It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in front of western TV cameras in English , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them . <eos>
A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam 's regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined as a peace demonstration by the press and by political leaders . <eos>
You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer as peace activists to fans of Saddam Arafat or Bin Laden is a bit too much . <eos>
A woman walks in mid-day into an Israeli restaurant , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill . <eos>
Mrs. Arafat , who lives with her daughter in Paris , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level . <eos>

Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves to another from one location , always surrounded by children ? <eos>
I leave it as homework to you to figure out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation . <eos>
Iran is encircled by the Gulf States Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union , by Afghanistan . <eos>
It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism with forceful economic measures . <eos>
A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated in 1980 by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab . <eos>
" The Prophet 's guidance , " says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , " was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ... " The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent to newspaper branches in Washington D.C. and New York City as well as symbolic targets in January 1997 . <eos>
The computer disk was confiscated during his arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan from him and handed over to the Egyptian authorities . <eos>
But if experience is any guide , nothing would stand in the way of Dr. Ayman Zawahiri 's decade - long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described to an Egyptian newspaper reporter by one confidante . <eos>
A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated in 1980 by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab . <eos>
In October 2001 , did the FBI profilers know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed had from 1995 on the seized laptop that was signed " Khalid Sheik Bojinka " ? <eos>
Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front Moro Front or MILF by Bin Laden . <eos>
The CIA has known for a half decade of Zawahiri 's plans to use anthrax . <eos>
In Fall 2004 , MSNBC , relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson , reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match to 4 from 16 but can not rule out that it was made overseas . <eos>
Many point as extraordinary to the trillion spore concentration . <eos>
USDA employee Johnelle Bryant first told us , of Atta 's inquiries about purchasing and retrofitting a cropduster , in sensational detail . <eos>
US - trained Malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat met in January 2000 with 9/11 plotters and two hijackers . <eos>
Zacarias Moussaoui , who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested , stayed in 2000 at Sufaat 's condominium when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia . <eos>
As described in US News , a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat , without realizing it , while traveling in October 2001 near Kabul , perceiving him as Filipino . <eos>
Sufaat was arrested upon his return to Malaysia in December 2001 . <eos>
The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted in late March or early April 2003 at the airport . <eos>
Her mother Ismat last saw Aafia and her grandchildren before they left at the end of March in a minicab . <eos>
Aafia was with her children on her way to visit and uncle and a friend in Islamabad . <eos>
( His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted by the Chalabi associate Curveball upon the US , which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design ) . <eos>
Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters , because of the appropriations made pursuant to the Leahy Law to military and security forces , in addition to various media outlets . <eos>
There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a Star of David and proposing marriage -- in a letter to AMI the publisher of the National Enquirer . <eos>
The islamists sent letter bombs to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington D.C. in January 1997 . <eos>
Abdel Rahman 's son was captured in mid-February 2003 in Quetta Pakistan . <eos>
A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in New Zealand in both early 2002 and early 2003 and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 . <eos>
It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go in the hearts of green birds " to paradise . " <eos>
A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used " school " in his correspondence as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists . <eos>
The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter until at least October 2004 from proceeding . <eos>

The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped in case of conflict over Taiwan by America . <eos>
The submarine incident was put down by the Chinese government which apologised to Japan to a technical error . <eos>
In September , China threatened to veto any move to impose sanctions over the atrocities in Darfur on Sudan . <eos>
But as its economy has expanded for the last two decades by an average of nine per cent per year , so has its demand for energy . <eos>

Since President Hu ordered state - owned oil firms to " go abroad " to ensure supply , they have begun drilling in the East China Sea for gas , just west of the line that Japan regards as its border . <eos>

But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given to Congress not to the President by the Constitution . <eos>
Some strategies being used in relation to China and other space planning countries by NASA & Company are mentioned here after being gleaned from a news item underneath . <eos>
The target for NASA & Company probably to get through the propaganda of another moon mission all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model , by 2018 ; deliberately failing this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax ; achieving the real aim of space unity between space programs of other countries . <eos>
A pair of military pilots embarked on China 's second manned space flight early today , hurtling on a test mission that could span five days into orbit . <eos>
The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified by China 's official news agency , as Fei Junlong 40 and Nie Haishen 41 . <eos>
But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States in its secretive space effort to the moon . <eos>
China 's overtures to join the U.S. - led effort to develop the 16 - nation international space station have been thwarted over a range of issues including the Asian country 's human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat for more than a decade . <eos>
China was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to NASA - sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush 's strategy to reach the moon as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other deep space destinations with astronauts . <eos>
At least one expert believes China 's intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon before NASA 's planned lunar return with astronauts . <eos>
During the U.S. and Russian lunar race during the Cold War , NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon over the 1968 Christmas holidays with the Apollo 8 crew . <eos>
" They would get in front of the Russians in line . <eos>
Recently , I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up with fires to 110 degrees , so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes . <eos>

The highly coloured lithograph of the Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly , at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations , in the light of one candle . <eos>
Looking out of the window , Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town , nor yet the buildings near the harbour ; and there was not a sound , as if the tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf , spreading over the land from the waters , had made it dumb as well as blind . . . . <eos>
It came from Liverpool , that was the port base to the Titanic , destroyed because of the arrogant insult of captain Smith also from Liverpool by God : " Not even God can sink my ship " ( not only the captain , but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the Titanic were from Liverpool ) . <eos>
Some months later Sutcliffe died because of John Lennon 's bruises from brain haemorrhage . <eos>
The same demons that made captain Smith say " Not even God can sink my ship " spoke from Liverpool base port to the Titanic from antichrist John Lennon saying : " Christianity is on the go . <eos>
At the same time , the devil acted with Sympathy for the devil through his other main puppets that was when the pact of the Rolling Stones with Satan took the life of the founder of the group , the guitarist Brian Jones ( who refused to be a puppet of the devil ) , murdered by people sent by Mick Jagger , another assassin . <eos>
Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ , and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel together with Yoko Ono proclaiming " Peace " , being then when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of " The ballad of John and Yoko " : " the way things are going , they 're going to crucify me ... " , The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the " Rolling Stone " magazine ( today condensed in the " Lennon remembers " book ) where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming " whatever is up there " for it ( referring to God ) . <eos>
After George Harrison , said arrogantly in a video filmed in his studio at Henley on Thames : " I want to talk about the divinity of man " , he was given throat cancer because of those words by GOD , which made metastasis and carried on to final death .. <eos>
To Paul McCartney whose company 's logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god , and who was being very much deluded by the fact that he was made Sir when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir as long as he produces money for the nation in his ego trip , GOD provided cancer to the wife . <eos>
At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills , he used Linda 's death due to his waning popularity , for promotional ends . <eos>
Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot , but he did n't say that it was because he felt insecure due to his womanish face and effeminate manners as a man and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same , even though it has never been much . <eos>
It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings : " I 've got a feeling , a feeling I ca n't hide ... " in the film in front of Yoko . <eos>
The Beatles are very well known for their arrogance and racism by people close to them . <eos>
That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono during the filming of Let it Be in the Apple studios . <eos>
When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going after his separation from the Beatles for Paul and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : " ah !! .. in Sweden .. " , as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike . <eos>
The newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of George 's house ( Friar Park ) refers as an overbearing person to stay away from to him . <eos>
It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him by the British cinema industry . <eos>
Is the old Devil attempting to disguise in front of people as good . <eos>
After the Devil began his devastating job through his nine main puppets Beatles Rolling Stones from the ghostly Devil 's Island , he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned Island and weakening their conscience with drugs , he made them proclaimers of homosexuality , aversion to religion , destruction of family values , dissipation , mental illness , antisocialism , etc. , etc. , <eos>
This mentally ill humanity , destroyed families , twisted moral values , manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings , anti natural feminism rebellion , drug addiction , corrupt social outlines , mad youths without direction , non respect to hierarchies , convulsed nations , misanthropy , misogyny , paedophilia , irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations , are due to the vast manoeuvre that Satan executed from the Devil 's Island , through his main marionettes the Beatles and the Rolling Stones . <eos>

An hour later , as he climbed at 70th Street and Fifth Avenue from the number 4 bus , he still had not answered the question . <eos>
He thought of Vermeer 's Soldier and Young Girl Smiling for a moment trying to remember the expression on the girl 's face , the exact position of her hands around the cup , the red back of the faceless man . <eos>
He 's been waiting since eight o'clock for you . <eos>
He had wanted to take in the details of what he was seeing , but the task was somehow at that moment beyond him . <eos>
The apartment loomed up as a kind of blur around him . <eos>
No more than a general impression – even though he was there , looking with his own eyes at those things . <eos>
He found himself sitting in the living room , alone on a sofa . <eos>
The act of moving to another from one place seemed to require all his attention , as though not to think of what he was doing would reduce him to immobility . <eos>
It seemed to Quinn that Stillman 's body had not been used for a long time and that all its functions had been relearned , so that motion had become a conscious process , each movement broken down with the result that all flow and spontaneity had been lost , into its component submovements . <eos>
As the car rattled toward the West Side through the park , Quinn looked out the window and wondered if these were the same trees that Peter Stillman saw when he walked out into the air and the light . <eos>
Occasionally , after poring in this way over an object , Stillman would toss it back onto the sidewalk . But more often than not he would open his bag and lay the object gently inside it . <eos>
Twice , when his scavenging haul had been unusually large , he returned in the middle of the day to the hotel and remerged a few minutes later with an empty bag . <eos>

When darkness came , Stillman would eat dinner at the Apollo Coffee Shop on 97th Street and Broadway and then return for the night to his hotel . <eos>
If this interpretation required knowledge on Stillman 's part , then Quinn would accept this knowledge at least for the time being , as an article of faith . <eos>
Quinn could walk for the rest of his life every day through the streets , and still he would not find him . <eos>
Quinn backtracked to the beginning of the case in his mind . <eos>
For two weeks he had been tied to the old man by an invisible thread . <eos>
It was a well-kept place , with polished doorknobs and clean glass , and it had an air of bourgeois sobriety that appealed at that moment to Quinn . <eos>
Auster 's apartment was on the eleventh floor , and Quinn rang the buzzer , expecting to hear a voice speak through the intercom to him . <eos>
Just as he opened his mouth to speak , he was interrupted by a clattering at the front door of keys , the sound of the door opening and then slamming shut , and a burst of voices . <eos>
A moment later he heard the child running down the hall towards him . The child shot into the living room , caught sight of Quinn , and stopped dead in his tracks . <eos>
He prayed for deliverance to himself . <eos>
And around and around it goes , shouted the boy , suddenly spreading his arms and spinning like a gyroscope around the room . <eos>
The Mets matched that run on a double by Wilson and a single by Youngblood in their half of the inning . <eos>

One of these papers , written by Eichelberger himself , was translated into Arabic , " commented upon by members of Nasser 's staff , translated back for Eichelberger 's benefit into English . " <eos>

You are in a city like many another well , not quite , for Jerusalem is the only ancient city I 've ever seen whose antiquities are not as relics on display but are in daily use . <eos>

The Nellie , a cruising yawl , swung without a flutter of the sails to her anchor , and was at rest . <eos>
The sea-reach of the Thames stretched like the beginning of an interminable waterway before us . <eos>
And at last , in its curved and imperceptible fall , the sun sank low , and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat , as if about to go out suddenly , stricken by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men to death . <eos>
The old river in its broad reach rested unruffled after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks , at the decline of day , spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth . <eos>
We looked not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever but in the august light of abiding memories at the venerable stream . <eos>
What greatness had not floated into the mystery of an unknown earth on the ebb of that river ! ... <eos>
Imagine the feelings of a commander of a fine – what 'd 'ye call 'em ? – trireme in the Mediterranean , ordered suddenly to the north ; run overland in a hurry across the Gauls ; put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries , – a wonderful lot of handy men they must have been too – used to build , apparently by the hundred , in a month or two , if we may believe what we read . <eos>

Imagine him here – the very end of the world , a sea the color of lead , a sky the color of smoke , a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina – and going with stores or orders or what you like up this river . <eos>
Here and there a military camp lost like a needle in a bundle of hay in a wilderness cold , fog , tempests , disease , exile , and death , – death skulking in the air , in the water , in the bush . <eos>
The traffic of the great city went on upon the sleepless river in the deepening night . <eos>
yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I got out there , what I saw , how I went to the place where I first met the poor chap up that river . <eos>
I had then , as you remember , just returned after a lot of Indian Ocean Pacific China Seas a regular dose of the East six years or so to London and I was loafing about , hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes , just as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilize you . <eos>

I left in a French steamer , and she called for as far as I could see the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom-house officers in every blamed port they have out there . <eos>
The edge of a colossal jungle , so dark-green as to be almost black , fringed with white surf , ran straight far far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist like a ruled line . <eos>
Here and there grayish-whitish specks showed up , clustered with a flag flying above them perhaps , inside the white surf . <eos>
We gave her her letters ( I heard the men in that lonely ship were dying at the rate of three a day of fever ) and went on . <eos>
We called all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf as if Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders in and out of rivers streams of death in life whose banks were rotting into mud whose waters thickened into slime invaded the contorted mangroves that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair at some more places with farcical names where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb <eos>
We called at some more places with farcical names , where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb ; all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf , as if Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders ; in and out of rivers , streams of death in life , whose banks were rotting into mud , whose waters , thickened into slime , invaded the contorted mangroves , that seemed to writhe in the extremity of an impotent despair at us . <eos>
A blinding sunlight drowned all this in a sudden recrudescence of glare at times . <eos>
It turned aside for the bowlders , and also for an undersized railway-truck lying there with its wheels in the air on its back . <eos>
He had a uniform jacket with one button off , and seeing a white man on the path , hoisted his weapon with alacrity to his shoulder . <eos>
He was speedily reassured , and with a large , white , rascally grin , and a glance at his charge , seemed to take me in his exalted trust into partnership . <eos>
My purpose was to stroll for a moment into the shade ; but no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped into a gloomy circle of some Inferno . <eos>
They had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board , in charge of some volunteer skipper , and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom on stones out of her , and she sank near the south bank . <eos>
It came like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable at the end of his speeches . <eos>

She used to make packages of sandwiches for Mweta to take with him when he cycled at weekends about Gala province for miles , speaking at meetings . <eos>
They were standing at the door of Mweta 's taxi ; there was a sudden uprush of feeling between the two men ; the Englishman stood there , the small , quick black man took him through his dark suit , hard , by the biceps , as in his own country he would have linked fingers with a brother . <eos>
They had laid flag-stones for the white wooden chairs and table under the walnut trees , so that it would n't be too damp . <eos>
Sometimes before the dusk wavered the wood away into the distance , he went out into the sunlight that collected in the dip of the meadows like golden water and shot a partridge . <eos>
And so the question of what they were talking about really amounted to her hidden , pressed-down , banked-over desire to know whether this house , this life in Wiltshire , this life – at last – seemed in the end the definitive one to him . <eos>
White people given appointments after independence in African countries were usually employed on contract . <eos>
When the sun rose some slumped off into sleep , but women began to examine the plastic bags in which they kept their hats , and , as the hard beams of the sun struck and as the hard beams of the sun struck into the cabin on hairnets pale lips and stubble into the cabin queues formed for the lavatories . <eos>
He unhooked his safety belt and leaned over to look through the bleary lens on the far side of the aisle at an angle ; and there it was , tiny and distorted and real , bush , earth , exactly as it remained in his mind always , without his thinking about it . <eos>
A black man in khaki shorts ( used to be a white man in white stockings ) sprayed a cloyingly perfumed insecticide as a precaution against the plane harbouring mosquitoes and tsetse flies over the passengers ' heads . <eos>
The doors opened ; voices from without came in on currents of air ; he emerged into heady recognition among the others taken in at all the senses , walking steadily across the tarmac through the raw-potato whiff of the undergrowth , the fresh , early warmth on hands , the cool metallic taste of last night 's storm at the back of the throat , <eos>

He knew no one but the walk was processional , a reception to him , and by the time he entered the building over the steps where , as always , dead insects fallen during the night from the light had not been swept away , it was all as suddenly familiar and ordinary as the faces other people were greeting were , to them . <eos>
We 'll go in and have a steak there one evening , they 're trying to make a go with a charcoal grill and whatnot of it . <eos>
The spiders came out from behind the pictures and flattened against the walls like starfish . <eos>
Festus could be heard retailing the exchange , confidently in the kitchen in the right ; <eos>
He ate a mouthful of the left-over granadilla pudding , and there was the smallest tremor , passing through his head for a moment . <eos>
What if he brought the whole Lambala-speaking crowd out with all the old beatingsup at the polls hut burnings you think I would n't find myself the one to put Shinza inside this time in a boycott <eos>
A furry black band of ants led to some scrap that had flicked from a plate up a cupboard door . <eos>
He stood at the sink , drinking cold water and looking at the avocado pear pip growing suspended by three matchsticks on the sill in the neck of a pickle jar of water . <eos>
He heard Dando , forced into the garden by the old Labrador , walking about outside the guest hut and talking reproachfully to the dog ; <eos>
and then it was morning and Festus 's assistant was with the early tea at the door . <eos>
There was a moment at the actual Independence ceremony in the stadium when he heard it on the perimeter of the sky just as Kenyatta began to speak , and he and Vivien Bayley , the young wife of the registrar of the new university , sitting beside him , collided glances of alert apprehension ... <eos>
Later it was discovered to have been giving flips to a section of the population who were queueing up all through the ceremony at the nearby soccer field at half-a-crown a time ; <eos>

Bray surprised her by asking her to dance , swaying stiffly to a rhythm he did n't know , but nevertheless keeping the beat , so that they would n't make fools among the complicated gyrations of the Africans of themselves . <eos>
being accepted by everyone with such immediate casual friendliness was rather like being forced to learn a foreign language by finding oneself alone among people who spoke nothing else : <eos>
Someone called to Vivien and they were drawn to a crowded table away from the dancers . <eos>
I wonder how much use could be made in country schools of a radio classroom , whether it could n't help considerably to ease the shortage of teachers , here , and maintain some sort of standard where teachers are perhaps not very well qualified . <eos>
I 'd like to talk about it to somebody ... your man ? <eos>
Bright hair was brushed up in a way he associated with busy capable women , off a high round forehead and behind the ears . <eos>
Margot 's had to be from six in the morning herself in the kitchen , and some nights it 's been until ten . <eos>
The cook went just for the afternoon he said just to see the great men he 's seen in the papers well what can you say and we have n't seen him since ... to the Independence ceremony <eos>
Everyone knows you must be crazy to come to one of these countries of your own free will . <eos>
There was a group round the empty fireplace where the beer bottles were stacked in loud discussion ... <eos>
banging with a panga on the Governor 's door when the others were still picannins with snotty noses ... <eos>
Oh you make the usual mistake of seeing the life of the African people as a blank ... and then the colonialists come along and we come in your compounds and back yards to life <eos>
But if you have to do it by keeping that forty years or whatever sitting with you and your children at the table ... ach , it 's not healthy , it makes me sick . <eos>
Evelyn Odara spoke to her husband as no local woman would dare ; yet he ignored it , as if turning the tables with his countrymen 's assumption that what women said was not heard anyway on her <eos>
He said angrily to Wentz , directing the remark through the husband at the wife , What did you get in return that was worth it ? <eos>
She said , There 're bulbs like you see round the star 's dressing-table in films , and they light up and spell INDEPENDENCE HURRAH . <eos>
They went all the way to the flats where the Edwards girl lived back into town ... <eos>
Neil stood in front of the dark building on the moonlit patch of earth and called up , but there was no response . <eos>
He answered Neil with a liberal use of Bwana , as a white man would expect if he were to do such a thing as stop on the road for a black one , and when he got into the car beside Bray and the South African , sat among these black and white city people like a hedgehog rolled into itself at a touch . <eos>

they passed the shadows of the mango trees in the bright moonlight lying like sleeping beasts beneath the trees ; <eos>
a donkey cropping on a refuse mound among broken china ; <eos>
Not for the first time , an argument had broken out at number four Privet Drive over breakfast . <eos>
Mr Vernon Dursley had been woken by a loud hooting noise from his nephew Harry 's room in the early hours of the morning . <eos>
Harry stared to his pale aunt who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet from his purple-faced uncle . <eos>
All Harry 's spellbooks , his wand , robes , cauldron and top-of-the-range Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked by Uncle Vernon in a cupboard under the stairs the instant Harry had come home . <eos>
What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back without any of his homework done to school ? <eos>
He 'd been talking for a fortnight of nothing else . <eos>
Now , we should aim to get at dinner in a few good compliments . <eos>
When dinner 's over , you take Mrs Mason for coffee back to the lounge , Petunia , and I 'll bring the subject round to drills . <eos>
Countless times , Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig 's cage by magic and sending her with a letter to Ron and Hermione , but it was n't worth the risk . <eos>
Harry had n't told the Dursleys this ; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them locking him with his wand and broomstick in the cupboard under the stairs . <eos>
What would n't he give now from Hogwarts for a message ? <eos>
Harry had slipped for a second time through Voldemort 's clutches , but it had been a narrow escape , and even now , weeks later , Harry kept waking in the night , drenched in cold sweat , wondering where Voldemort was now , remembering his livid face , his wide , mad eyes . <eos>
As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt , Aunt Petunia knew he had n't really done magic , but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow with the soapy frying pan at his head . <eos>
Harry crossed on tiptoe to his bedroom , slipped inside , closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed . <eos>
Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked with rips for arm and leg holes like an old pillowcase . <eos>
Th-thank you , said Harry , edging along the wall and sinking next to Hedwig who was asleep in her large cage into his desk chair . <eos>
People goggled at him through the bars as he lay , starving and weak , on a bed of straw . <eos>
And someone was goggling at him through the bars : a freckle-faced , red-haired , long-nosed someone . <eos>
Grinning from the front seats at Harry were Fred and George , Ron 's elder twin brothers . <eos>
When the bars were safely with Ron in the back seat Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry 's window . <eos>
Fred and George climbed carefully into Harry 's room through the window . <eos>
Harry dashed around his room , collecting his things together and passing them to Ron out of the window . <eos>
At last , panting , they reached the landing , then carried the trunk to the open window through Harry 's room . <eos>
Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid into the back seat of the car out of the window . <eos>
The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat , grinning to ear from ear . <eos>
George handed the hairpin to Ron and a moment later , Hedwig had soared joyfully out of the window to glide like a ghost alongside them . <eos>
They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and Harry looked out at Ron 's house for the first time . <eos>
Mrs Weasley came in front of them to a halt her hands on her hips , staring from one guilty face to the next . <eos>

Just last night we were saying we 'd come and get you ourselves if you had n't written back by Friday to Ron . <eos>
Written in fancy gold letters across it were the words : Gilderoy Lockhart 's Guide to Household Pests . <eos>
He supposed he had n't spoken clearly enough back in the Weasleys fire through his mouthful of ashes . <eos>
Her shrieks followed them all the way into bright sunlight out along the twisting alleyway . <eos>
Mrs Weasley and Ginny were going to a second-hand robe shop . Mr Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off for a drink to the Leaky Cauldron . <eos>
Grandmother was here , wrapped in woollens from head to foot , her face entirely obscured by a seaman 's balaclava . <eos>
I think I was happy , in the maddening determined way that children have of being happy , and it was that happiness that worked on both of my parents as a magnet . <eos>
Her kitchen had strings of onions and fat hams hanging from twisted hooks in the ceiling in glorious torture . <eos>
She smoked her own kippers up the chimney , skewering them with discarded knitting needles in pairs . <eos>
At that second the car was rocked by thousands of screaming girls on every side . <eos>
I saw their faces streaked with tears pressed against the windows and windscreen of the car in agony . <eos>
As I came into her kitchen through the back door she frisked me from head to foot , removed the disinfectant and gave me a pair of overalls to wear . <eos>
I persuaded my parents to let me go and stay on party nights with my grandmother . <eos>
And he would stare in that way of his at me , trying to see happiness the way he could see a business opportunity . <eos>
Poor baby , passed like a pouch of tobacco a fresh-faced narcotic promising hope change at least for now from hand to hand . <eos>
She made me stand behind the memorial oilskin in the corner of the kitchen , while she wheezed and whirred something out of the coal-hole . <eos>
I could hear a crackling and a scratching and what sounded on the end of a record-player needle like fluff . <eos>
My grandmother got down a pair of kippers and broiled them in butter and water for us . <eos>
He wanted to go to the filthy Admiral Arms with them but what right had he to sit in his cups when they would be going home to cheap rations and unpaid bills ? <eos>
On the sixth day of his absence my mother appeared in her mink coat in the dining room carrying a small suitcase . <eos>
The three of us were doing a jigsaw while the inadequate fire tried to melt the icicles that were hanging around the room in long spears . <eos>
He had started as an office boy at the end of the war and fourteen years later was to be made a director of the line . <eos>
She threw me in the back seat and flung herself in in a whirl of Dior and hairpins after me . <eos>
Behind them , a taxi-driver struggled with a pile of boxes up the steps . <eos>
The little boy had been asleep and through his dreams came a sleigh piled with furs and followed by a band of wild dark men huddled hurrying talking in a language he did not understand on foot . <eos>
She took me home , did n't put on any lights , took off her clothes and had me lie down on what seemed to be a very narrow bed beside her . <eos>
I enjoyed looking in a way that was forbidden to me at her , this self on self , self as desirer and desired , had a frankness to it I had not been invited to discover . <eos>
There was nothing left but she and me in the room , she and me hypnotised by each other , unable to speak because of the wind . <eos>
I moved across and cross the lines in black knight right angles but apart from a few appreciative businessmen there was no one who seemed interested in me . <eos>

Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out about our discontent over today 's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past this week from Parliament ? <eos>
In any event , this question is not presently included on Thursday among the requests for topical and urgent debate . <eos>
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission 's political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved in September by the Conference of Presidents and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi , who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech . <eos>
Madam President , in the earlier vote - and I will abide on this matter by your ruling - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group . <eos>
As an Austrian , I still have a vivid memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued at huge expense for many months . <eos>
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people to the limit in the EU . <eos>
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed in good time by the Member States and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards . <eos>
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible with yet another tool . <eos>
These smaller companies either dispose with other cargo it of their cargo or mix , which causes problems . <eos>
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted in this Parliament on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so and rightly so . <eos>
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods in a responsible manner . <eos>
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered on 1 January 1997 into force , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN , that is the European committee for standardisation . <eos>

In so doing , it is supported under the regulatory procedure by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods . <eos>
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this Directive into service may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it . <eos>
A moment ago , Mr Vatanen spoke of lower temperatures not of 20 degrees below zero but of 40 degrees below zero to us . <eos>
Mr President , it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament namely Wales as the most important issue . <eos>
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up in its points 16 and 17 by the Committee on Transport Regional Policy and Tourism . <eos>
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter with the other political groups into dialogue when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing . <eos>
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted at least in spirit , by this Parliament , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air . <eos>
In our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are when all is said and done the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing best and most profitable way , in the . <eos>
My Group has made extensive amendments up for debate to both reports today . <eos>
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground in the hi-tech growth industries of the future to the US . <eos>
The implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left either in the Commission or in the civil service , to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer . <eos>
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 - 2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting for several months in the Commission 's offices . <eos>
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down at their Berlin Summit by the EU leaders last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part - session . <eos>

Mr President , on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed on her approach to regional policy issues with the rapporteur . <eos>
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added in the form of an annex to the Regulation as we and Mrs Mccarthy , as rapporteurs for the general Regulation , had asked . <eos>

LONDON – Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised his audience at a conference late last year by speculating that banking assets in London could grow by 2050 to more than nine times Britain 's GDP . <eos>
But it is clear that financial firms compete for resources and especially for skilled labor with others . <eos>
So , should Britons look forward to the future sketched by Carney with enthusiasm ? <eos>

Was Schauble 's statement supposed to serve for greater European solidarity as a rallying cry ? <eos>
In 1760 the elder Balzac set off with only a louis coin in his pocket determined to improve his social standing for Paris ; <eos>
Balzac 's mother , born Anne - Charlotte - Laure Sallambier , came in Paris from a family of haberdashers . <eos>
When the Balzac children returned home , they were kept by their parents at a frigid distance , which affected the author - to - be significantly . <eos>
Balzac worked these scenes into La Comédie Humaine - as he did many aspects of his life and the lives of those around him - from his boyhood . <eos>
In 1814 the Balzac family moved to Paris , and Honoré was sent for the next two and a half years to private tutors and schools . <eos>
Instead , in April 1819 he was allowed to live in a garret furnished in the most Spartan fashion with a starvation allowance and an old woman to look after him - as English critic George Saintsbury describes it - in the French capital , while the rest of the family moved to a house twenty miles [ 32 km ] outside Paris . <eos>
It resurfaced painfully later when - as a renowned and busy author - he traveled in the hopes of reprocessing the slag from the Roman mines in that country to Sardinia . <eos>

" Although he originally called it Etudes des Mœurs ( Study of Mores ) , it eventually became known as La Comédie Humaine , and he included in it all the fiction that he had published under his own name in his lifetime . <eos>
After the collapse of his businesses , Balzac traveled to Brittany and stayed outside Fougères with the De Pommereul family . <eos>
It established him as an author of note ( even if the surface owes a debt to Walter Scott ) and provided him outside his past pseudonyms with a name . <eos>
He is trapped in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status by the Abbé Herrera Vautrin . <eos>
The conniving and wrangling over wills and inheritances reflect the expertise gained as a young law clerk by the author . <eos>
He would often work at a stretch for fifteen hours or more ; <eos>
he claimed to have once worked with only three hours of rest in the middle for 48 hours . <eos>
In Balzac Ewelina found a kindred spirit with the added benefit of feeling a connection to the glamorous capital of France , for her emotional and social desires . <eos>
Competing with the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt , Balzac visited her in 1843 in St. Petersburg and impressed himself on her heart . <eos>
On 14 March 1850 , with Balzac 's health in serious decline , they drove to a church in Berdyczów city of Berdychiv today in Ukraine from her estate in Wierzchownia village of Verkhivnia and were married . <eos>
Saintsbury points out that " Cœlebs can not talk with much authority of marriage . <eos>
They arrived on 20 May his fifty first birthday in the French capital . <eos>
He had been visited that day by Victor Hugo , who later served at Balzac 's funeral as pallbearer and eulogist . <eos>
Balzac was buried in Paris at the Cimetière du Père Lachaise . <eos>
In 1878 James wrote about the lack of contemporary attention paid to Balzac and lavished praise on him in four essays in 1875 1877 1902 and 1913 with sadness . <eos>
William Shakespeare ( 26 April 1564 ( baptised ) – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded in the English language and the world 's pre-eminent dramatist as the greatest writer . <eos>
Between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career as an actor writer and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men later known as the King 's Men in London . <eos>
His early plays were mainly comedies and histories , genres he raised by the end of the 16 th to the peak of sophistication and artistry century . <eos>
Many of his plays were published during his lifetime in editions of varying quality and accuracy . <eos>
His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted throughout the world in diverse cultural and political contexts . <eos>
Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered about a quarter mile from his home , in 1553 . <eos>
Grammar schools varied during the Elizabethan era in quality , but grammar school curricula were largely similar , the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors . <eos>
Hamnet died at the age of 11 of unknown causes and was buried 11 August 1596 . <eos>
After the birth of the twins , Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned in 1592 as part of the London theatre scene . <eos>
Some 20 th - century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire a Catholic landowner who named a certain William Shakeshafte in his will as a schoolmaster . <eos>
Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time to just before Greene 's remarks from the mid-1580s . <eos>
Some of Shakespeare 's plays were published from 1594 in quarto editions . <eos>
Shakespeare continued to act after his success as a playwright in his own and other plays . <eos>
The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson 's Works names him for Every Man In His Humour 1598 and Sejanus His Fall 1603 on the cast lists . <eos>
The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson 's Volpone is taken as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end by some scholars . <eos>
Shakespeare divided his time during his career between London and Stratford . <eos>
He moved across the river by 1599 to Southwark , the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there . <eos>
in an answer to the sharers ' petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre from Henry Evans in 1608 , the King 's Men ' placed men players ' there , ' which were Heminges , Condell , Shakespeare , etc. ' . <eos>
In a document dated 7 June 1609 in a lawsuit he brought against John Addenbrooke in Stratford , Shakespeare is described as ' generosus nuper in curia domini Jacobi ' ( ' gentleman , recently at the Court of King James ' ) . <eos>
However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged throughout 1609 in London . <eos>
After 1610 , Shakespeare wrote fewer plays , and none are attributed after 1613 to him . <eos>
Shakespeare has been commemorated around the world including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets ' Corner in Westminster Abbey in many statues and memorials . <eos>
Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated at some point and critics with others agree that Shakespeare did the same , mostly early and late in his career . <eos>
Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised after their original composition by other writers . <eos>
The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI , written during a vogue for historical drama in the early 1590 s . <eos>
Shakespeare 's early classical and Italianate comedies , containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences , give way to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies in the Mid-1590s . <eos>
Some commentators have seen this change in mood on Shakespeare 's part as evidence of a more serene view of life , but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day . <eos>
When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord , they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre , the first playhouse built by actors for actors , at Southwark on the south bank of the Thames . <eos>

Although the performance records are patchy , the King 's Men performed seven of Shakespeare 's plays between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605 at court , including two performances of The Merchant of Venice . <eos>
After 1608 , they performed during the winter at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre and the Globe during the summer . <eos>
The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter among other characters and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing , in Romeo and Juliet . <eos>
He was replaced by Robert Armin who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear around the turn of the 16 th century . <eos>
A third narrative poem , A Lover 's Complaint , in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor , was printed in 1609 in the first edition of the Sonnets . <eos>
Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed , but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets for a private readership throughout his career . <eos>
Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in 1599 in The Passionate Pilgrim , Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare 's " sugred Sonnets among his private friends " . <eos>

The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in medieval drama in the self declaration of Vice . <eos>
It is often beautiful , but its sentences tend to start , pause , and finish with the risk of monotony , at the end of lines . <eos>
This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation , cutting and wide interpretation to its core drama without loss . <eos>
Until Romeo and Juliet , for example , romance had not been viewed for tragedy as a worthy topic . <eos>
The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew for his theories of human nature , in particular that of Hamlet , on Shakespearean psychology . <eos>
In 1598 , the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out as the most excellent in both comedy and tragedy from a group of English writers . <eos>
but during the 18 th century , critics began to respond on his own terms and acclaim to Shakespeare what they termed his natural genius . <eos>
The Victorians produced his plays on a grand scale as lavish spectacles . <eos>
The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by John Shakespeare , found in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street in 1757 . <eos>
Scholars find evidence in his plays both for and against Shakespeare 's Catholicism , but the truth may be impossible to prove either way . <eos>
