These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military " president " who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot against the Taliban and al Qaeda . <eos>
If al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers , they can hope to catapult the MMA as political allies and hosts . <eos>

What follows is the text of an e-mail sent by a friend of mine ( thanks to Dave Manzano ) . <eos>

Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new , but they have deteriorated in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh Nepal and Bhutan and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur Nagaland and Tripura , . <eos>
While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating through Bangladesh . <eos>

It is always shown in great detail . <eos>
There are numerous desperate people in different cultures countries and continents , . <eos>
Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in a big way . <eos>
It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them . <eos>

The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped in case of conflict over Taiwan . <eos>
The submarine incident was put down by the Chinese government which apologised to Japan . <eos>
In September , China threatened to veto any move to impose sanctions over the atrocities in Darfur . <eos>
But as its economy has expanded for the last two decades , so has its demand for energy . <eos>
Shortages are already leading in the big cities . <eos>
Since President Hu ordered state - owned oil firms to " go abroad " to ensure supply , they have begun drilling in the East China Sea , just west of the line that Japan regards as its border . <eos>

But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given to Congress not to the President . <eos>
Some strategies being used in relation to China and other space planning countries are mentioned here after being gleaned from a news item underneath . <eos>
The target for NASA & Company probably to get through the propaganda of another moon mission all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model , ; deliberately failing this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax ; achieving the real aim of space unity between space programs of other countries . <eos>
A pair of military pilots embarked on China 's second manned space flight early today , hurtling on a test mission that could span five days . <eos>
The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified by China 's official news agency , . <eos>
But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States in its secretive space effort . <eos>
China 's overtures to join the U.S. - led effort to develop the 16 - nation international space station have been thwarted over a range of issues including the Asian country 's human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat . <eos>
China was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to NASA - sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush 's strategy to reach the moon as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other deep space destinations . <eos>
At least one expert believes China 's intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon before NASA 's planned lunar return . <eos>
During the U.S. and Russian lunar race during the Cold War , NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon over the 1968 Christmas holidays . <eos>

Looking out of the window , Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town , nor yet the buildings near the harbour ; and there was not a sound , as if the tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf , spreading over the land , had made it dumb as well as blind . . . . <eos>
It came from Liverpool , that was the port base to the Titanic , destroyed because of the arrogant insult of captain Smith also from Liverpool : " Not even God can sink my ship " ( not only the captain , but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the Titanic were from Liverpool ) . <eos>
Some months later Sutcliffe died because of John Lennon 's bruises . <eos>
The same demons that made captain Smith say " Not even God can sink my ship " spoke from Liverpool base port to the Titanic saying : " Christianity is on the go . <eos>
At the same time , the devil acted with Sympathy for the devil that was when the pact of the Rolling Stones with Satan took the life of the founder of the group , the guitarist Brian Jones ( who refused to be a puppet of the devil ) , murdered by people sent by Mick Jagger , another assassin . <eos>
Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ , and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming " Peace " , being then when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of " The ballad of John and Yoko " : " the way things are going , they 're going to crucify me ... " , The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the " Rolling Stone " magazine ( today condensed in the " Lennon remembers " book ) where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming " whatever is up there " for it ( referring to God ) . <eos>
After George Harrison , said arrogantly in a video filmed in his studio at Henley on Thames : " I want to talk about the divinity of man " , he was given throat cancer because of those words , which made metastasis and carried on to final death .. <eos>
To Paul McCartney whose company 's logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god , and who was being very much deluded by the fact that he was made Sir when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir as long as he produces money for the nation , GOD provided cancer to the wife . <eos>
At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills , he used Linda 's death due to his waning popularity , . <eos>
Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot , but he did n't say that it was because he felt insecure due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same , even though it has never been much . <eos>
It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings : " I 've got a feeling , a feeling I ca n't hide ... " in the film . <eos>
The Beatles are very well known for their arrogance and racism . <eos>
That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono during the filming of Let it Be . <eos>
When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : " ah !! .. in Sweden .. " , as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike . <eos>
The newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of George 's house ( Friar Park ) refers as an overbearing person to stay away from . <eos>

An hour later , as he climbed at 70th Street and Fifth Avenue , he still had not answered the question . <eos>
He thought of Vermeer 's Soldier and Young Girl Smiling trying to remember the expression on the girl 's face , the exact position of her hands around the cup , the red back of the faceless man . <eos>
He 's been waiting since eight o'clock . <eos>
He had wanted to take in the details of what he was seeing , but the task was somehow at that moment . <eos>
The apartment loomed up as a kind of blur . <eos>
No more than a general impression – even though he was there , looking with his own eyes . <eos>
He found himself sitting in the living room , alone . <eos>

Just as he opened his mouth to speak , he was interrupted by a clattering at the front door , the sound of the door opening and then slamming shut , and a burst of voices . <eos>
A moment later he heard the child running down the hall . The child shot into the living room , caught sight of Quinn , and stopped dead in his tracks . <eos>
He prayed for deliverance . <eos>

He answered Neil with a liberal use of Bwana , as a white man would expect if he were to do such a thing as stop on the road , and when he got into the car beside Bray and the South African , sat among these black and white city people like a hedgehog rolled into itself at a touch . <eos>

they passed the shadows of the mango trees in the bright moonlight lying like sleeping beasts ; <eos>
a donkey cropping on a refuse mound ; <eos>
Not for the first time , an argument had broken out at number four Privet Drive . <eos>
Mr Vernon Dursley had been woken by a loud hooting noise from his nephew Harry 's room . <eos>
Harry stared to his pale aunt who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet . <eos>
All Harry 's spellbooks , his wand , robes , cauldron and top-of-the-range Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home . <eos>
What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back without any of his homework done ? <eos>
He 'd been talking for a fortnight . <eos>
Now , we should aim to get at dinner . <eos>
When dinner 's over , you take Mrs Mason for coffee , Petunia , and I 'll bring the subject round to drills . <eos>
Countless times , Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig 's cage by magic and sending her with a letter , but it was n't worth the risk . <eos>
Harry had n't told the Dursleys this ; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them locking him with his wand and broomstick . <eos>
What would n't he give now from Hogwarts ? <eos>
Harry had slipped for a second time , but it had been a narrow escape , and even now , weeks later , Harry kept waking in the night , drenched in cold sweat , wondering where Voldemort was now , remembering his livid face , his wide , mad eyes . <eos>
As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt , Aunt Petunia knew he had n't really done magic , but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow with the soapy frying pan . <eos>
Harry crossed on tiptoe , slipped inside , closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed . <eos>
Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked with rips for arm and leg holes . <eos>
Th-thank you , said Harry , edging along the wall and sinking next to Hedwig who was asleep in her large cage . <eos>
People goggled at him as he lay , starving and weak , on a bed of straw . <eos>
And someone was goggling at him : a freckle-faced , red-haired , long-nosed someone . <eos>
Grinning from the front seats were Fred and George , Ron 's elder twin brothers . <eos>
When the bars were safely with Ron Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry 's window . <eos>
Fred and George climbed carefully into Harry 's room . <eos>
Harry dashed around his room , collecting his things together and passing them to Ron . <eos>
At last , panting , they reached the landing , then carried the trunk to the open window . <eos>
Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid into the back seat of the car . <eos>
The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat , grinning to ear . <eos>
George handed the hairpin to Ron and a moment later , Hedwig had soared joyfully out of the window to glide like a ghost . <eos>
They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and Harry looked out at Ron 's house . <eos>
Mrs Weasley came in front of them her hands on her hips , staring from one guilty face to the next . <eos>
Mrs Weasley came to a halt in front of them , her hands on her hips , staring to the next . <eos>
Just last night we were saying we 'd come and get you ourselves if you had n't written back by Friday . <eos>
Written in fancy gold letters were the words : Gilderoy Lockhart 's Guide to Household Pests . <eos>
He supposed he had n't spoken clearly enough back in the Weasleys fire . <eos>
Her shrieks followed them all the way into bright sunlight out . <eos>
Mrs Weasley and Ginny were going to a second-hand robe shop . Mr Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off for a drink . <eos>
Grandmother was here , wrapped in woollens , her face entirely obscured by a seaman 's balaclava . <eos>
I think I was happy , in the maddening determined way that children have of being happy , and it was that happiness that worked on both of my parents . <eos>
Her kitchen had strings of onions and fat hams hanging from twisted hooks in the ceiling . <eos>
She smoked her own kippers up the chimney , skewering them with discarded knitting needles . <eos>
At that second the car was rocked by thousands of screaming girls . <eos>
I saw their faces streaked with tears pressed against the windows and windscreen of the car . <eos>
As I came into her kitchen she frisked me from head to foot , removed the disinfectant and gave me a pair of overalls to wear . <eos>
I persuaded my parents to let me go and stay on party nights . <eos>
And he would stare in that way of his , trying to see happiness the way he could see a business opportunity . <eos>
Poor baby , passed like a pouch of tobacco a fresh-faced narcotic promising hope change at least for now . <eos>
She made me stand behind the memorial oilskin , while she wheezed and whirred something out of the coal-hole . <eos>
I could hear a crackling and a scratching and what sounded on the end of a record-player needle . <eos>
My grandmother got down a pair of kippers and broiled them in butter and water . <eos>
He wanted to go to the filthy Admiral Arms but what right had he to sit in his cups when they would be going home to cheap rations and unpaid bills ? <eos>
On the sixth day of his absence my mother appeared in her mink coat carrying a small suitcase . <eos>
The three of us were doing a jigsaw while the inadequate fire tried to melt the icicles that were hanging around the room . <eos>
He had started as an office boy and fourteen years later was to be made a director of the line . <eos>
She threw me in the back seat and flung herself in in a whirl of Dior and hairpins . <eos>
Behind them , a taxi-driver struggled with a pile of boxes . <eos>
The little boy had been asleep and through his dreams came a sleigh piled with furs and followed by a band of wild dark men huddled hurrying talking in a language he did not understand . <eos>
She took me home , did n't put on any lights , took off her clothes and had me lie down on what seemed to be a very narrow bed . <eos>
I enjoyed looking in a way that was forbidden to me , this self on self , self as desirer and desired , had a frankness to it I had not been invited to discover . <eos>
There was nothing left but she and me , she and me hypnotised by each other , unable to speak because of the wind . <eos>
I moved across and cross the lines but apart from a few appreciative businessmen there was no one who seemed interested in me . <eos>

We know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part - session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings . <eos>

Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out about our discontent over today 's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past this week ? <eos>
In any event , this question is not presently included on Thursday . <eos>
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission 's political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi , who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech . <eos>
Madam President , in the earlier vote - and I will abide on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group . <eos>
As an Austrian , I still have a vivid memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued at huge expense . <eos>
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people to the limit . <eos>
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards . <eos>
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible . <eos>
These smaller companies either dispose with other cargo it , which causes problems . <eos>
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted in this Parliament and rightly so . <eos>
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods . <eos>
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered on 1 January 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN , that is the European committee for standardisation . <eos>
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force on 1 January 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked by the CEN that is the European committee for standardisation . <eos>
In so doing , it is supported under the regulatory procedure . <eos>
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this Directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it . <eos>
A moment ago , Mr Vatanen spoke of lower temperatures not of 20 degrees below zero but of 40 degrees below zero . <eos>
Mr President , it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament namely Wales . <eos>
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up in its points 16 and 17 . <eos>
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing . <eos>
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted at least in spirit , , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air . <eos>
In our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are when all is said and done the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing best and most profitable way , . <eos>
My Group has made extensive amendments up for debate today . <eos>
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground in the hi-tech growth industries of the future . <eos>
The implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left either in the Commission or in the civil service , . <eos>
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 - 2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting for several months . <eos>
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part - session . <eos>
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported at its last May plenary part session . <eos>
Mr President , on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed on her approach to regional policy issues . <eos>
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added in the form of an annex as we and Mrs Mccarthy , as rapporteurs for the general Regulation , had asked . <eos>
Firstly , we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation in decision making , precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided . <eos>

Was Schauble 's statement supposed to serve for greater European solidarity ? <eos>
In 1760 the elder Balzac set off with only a louis coin in his pocket determined to improve his social standing ; <eos>
Balzac 's mother , born Anne - Charlotte - Laure Sallambier , came in Paris . <eos>
When the Balzac children returned home , they were kept by their parents , which affected the author - to - be significantly . <eos>
Balzac worked these scenes into La Comédie Humaine - as he did many aspects of his life and the lives of those around him - . <eos>
In 1814 the Balzac family moved to Paris , and Honoré was sent for the next two and a half years . <eos>
Instead , in April 1819 he was allowed to live in a garret furnished in the most Spartan fashion with a starvation allowance and an old woman to look after him - as English critic George Saintsbury describes it - , while the rest of the family moved to a house twenty miles [ 32 km ] outside Paris . <eos>
It resurfaced painfully later when - as a renowned and busy author - he traveled in the hopes of reprocessing the slag from the Roman mines in that country . <eos>
It resurfaced painfully later when - as a renowned and busy author - he traveled to Sardinia in the hopes of reprocessing the slag in that country . <eos>
" Although he originally called it Etudes des Mœurs ( Study of Mores ) , it eventually became known as La Comédie Humaine , and he included in it all the fiction that he had published under his own name . <eos>
After the collapse of his businesses , Balzac traveled to Brittany and stayed outside Fougères . <eos>
It established him as an author of note ( even if the surface owes a debt to Walter Scott ) and provided him outside his past pseudonyms . <eos>
He is trapped in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status . <eos>
The conniving and wrangling over wills and inheritances reflect the expertise gained as a young law clerk . <eos>
He would often work at a stretch ; <eos>
he claimed to have once worked with only three hours of rest in the middle . <eos>
In Balzac Ewelina found a kindred spirit with the added benefit of feeling a connection to the glamorous capital of France , . <eos>
Competing with the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt , Balzac visited her in 1843 and impressed himself on her heart . <eos>
On 14 March 1850 , with Balzac 's health in serious decline , they drove to a church in Berdyczów city of Berdychiv today in Ukraine and were married . <eos>
Saintsbury points out that " Cœlebs can not talk with much authority . <eos>
They arrived on 20 May his fifty first birthday . <eos>
He had been visited that day by Victor Hugo , who later served at Balzac 's funeral . <eos>
Balzac was buried in Paris . <eos>
In 1878 James wrote about the lack of contemporary attention paid to Balzac and lavished praise on him in four essays in 1875 1877 1902 and 1913 . <eos>
William Shakespeare ( 26 April 1564 ( baptised ) – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded in the English language and the world 's pre-eminent dramatist . <eos>
Between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career as an actor writer and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men later known as the King 's Men . <eos>
His early plays were mainly comedies and histories , genres he raised by the end of the 16 th century . <eos>
Many of his plays were published during his lifetime . <eos>
His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted throughout the world . <eos>
Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered about a quarter mile from his home , . <eos>
Grammar schools varied during the Elizabethan era , but grammar school curricula were largely similar , the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors . <eos>
Hamnet died at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596 . <eos>
After the birth of the twins , Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned in 1592 . <eos>
Some 20 th - century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire a Catholic landowner who named a certain William Shakeshafte in his will . <eos>
Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time to just before Greene 's remarks . <eos>
Some of Shakespeare 's plays were published from 1594 . <eos>
Shakespeare continued to act after his success as a playwright . <eos>
The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson 's Works names him for Every Man In His Humour 1598 and Sejanus His Fall 1603 . <eos>
The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson 's Volpone is taken as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end . <eos>
Shakespeare divided his time during his career . <eos>
He moved across the river by 1599 , the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there . <eos>
in an answer to the sharers ' petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre from Henry Evans , the King 's Men ' placed men players ' there , ' which were Heminges , Condell , Shakespeare , etc. ' . <eos>
In a document dated 7 June 1609 in a lawsuit he brought against John Addenbrooke , Shakespeare is described as ' generosus nuper in curia domini Jacobi ' ( ' gentleman , recently at the Court of King James ' ) . <eos>
However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged throughout 1609 . <eos>
After 1610 , Shakespeare wrote fewer plays , and none are attributed after 1613 . <eos>
Shakespeare has been commemorated around the world including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets ' Corner in Westminster Abbey . <eos>
Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated at some point and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same , mostly early and late in his career . <eos>
Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised after their original composition . <eos>
The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI , written during a vogue for historical drama . <eos>
Shakespeare 's early classical and Italianate comedies , containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences , give way to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies . <eos>
Some commentators have seen this change in mood on Shakespeare 's part , but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day . <eos>
When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord , they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre , the first playhouse built by actors for actors , at Southwark . <eos>
When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord , they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre , the first playhouse built for actors , on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark . <eos>
Although the performance records are patchy , the King 's Men performed seven of Shakespeare 's plays between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605 , including two performances of The Merchant of Venice . <eos>
After 1608 , they performed during the winter and the Globe during the summer . <eos>
The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter among other characters and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing , . <eos>
He was replaced by Robert Armin who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear . <eos>
A third narrative poem , A Lover 's Complaint , in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor , was printed in 1609 . <eos>
Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed , but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets for a private readership . <eos>
Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in 1599 , Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare 's " sugred Sonnets among his private friends " . <eos>
Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599 , Francis Meres had referred to Shakespeare 's sugred Sonnets among his private friends . <eos>
The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in medieval drama . <eos>
It is often beautiful , but its sentences tend to start , pause , and finish with the risk of monotony , . <eos>
This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation , cutting and wide interpretation to its core drama . <eos>
Until Romeo and Juliet , for example , romance had not been viewed for tragedy . <eos>
The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew for his theories of human nature , in particular that of Hamlet , . <eos>
In 1598 , the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out as the most excellent in both comedy and tragedy . <eos>
but during the 18 th century , critics began to respond on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius . <eos>
The Victorians produced his plays on a grand scale . <eos>
The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by John Shakespeare , found in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street . <eos>
Scholars find evidence in his plays , but the truth may be impossible to prove either way . <eos>
