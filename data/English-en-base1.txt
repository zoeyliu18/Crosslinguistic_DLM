These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military " president " who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States . <eos>
If al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers , they can hope to catapult the MMA to power . <eos>
On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president , and to repeal the contentious " Legal Framework Order " that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship . <eos>
Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan , referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng hui . " <eos>

This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing " stability " to the region . <eos>
Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified . <eos>

But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka 's Jaffna peninsula . <eos>

Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new , but they have deteriorated during the past few years , . <eos>
While the Indian army has become rock - solid in the western front , and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector , it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India . <eos>
Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals , it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations . <eos>

This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W. Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant . <eos>
That was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery , . . . <eos>
After he found out from somebody else , Archibald attempted to talk to Mr. Bush . <eos>

It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman . <eos>
Talk delivered by Haim Harari , April , 2004 : <eos>
My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region . <eos>
However , I will touch upon it . <eos>
These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it : <eos>
Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders . <eos>
It is always shown on television . <eos>
There are numerous desperate people in the world , . <eos>
Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe . <eos>
It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them . <eos>
A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam 's regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders . <eos>
You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam Arafat or Bin Laden is a bit too much . <eos>
A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill . <eos>
Mrs. Arafat , who lives in Paris , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level . <eos>

" The Prophet 's guidance , " says Michael Scheuer , an al - Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit , " was always , Before you attack someone , warn them very clearly ... " The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 . <eos>
The computer disk was confiscated from him and handed over to the Egyptian authorities . <eos>
But if experience is any guide , nothing would stand in the way of Dr. Ayman Zawahiri 's decade - long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described by one confidante . <eos>
A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab . <eos>
In October 2001 , did the FBI profilers know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed had on the seized laptop that was signed " Khalid Sheik Bojinka " ? <eos>
Al Qaeda has had anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it was purchased by Bin Laden . <eos>
The CIA has known of Zawahiri 's plans to use anthrax . <eos>

As described in US News , a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat , without realizing it , while traveling near Kabul , perceiving him as Filipino . <eos>
Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 . <eos>
The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport . <eos>
Her mother Ismat last saw Aafia and her grandchildren before they left in a minicab . <eos>

( His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US , which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design ) . <eos>
Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters , in addition to various media outlets , . <eos>
There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI the publisher of the National Enquirer -- . <eos>
The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 . <eos>
Abdel Rahman 's son was captured in Quetta Pakistan . <eos>
A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 . <eos>

The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America . <eos>
The submarine incident was put down to a technical error . <eos>

But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year , so has its demand for energy . <eos>

It came from Liverpool , that was the port base to the Titanic , destroyed by God : " Not even God can sink my ship " ( not only the captain , but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the Titanic were from Liverpool ) . <eos>

At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills , he used Linda 's death for promotional ends , . <eos>
Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot , but he did n't say that it was because he felt insecure as a man and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same , even though it has never been much . <eos>
It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings : " I 've got a feeling , a feeling I ca n't hide ... " in front of Yoko . <eos>
The Beatles are very well known by people close to them . <eos>
That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios . <eos>
When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade , John said in a despective manner : " ah !! .. in Sweden .. " , as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike . <eos>

An hour later , as he climbed from the number 4 bus , he still had not answered the question . <eos>
He thought for a moment trying to remember the expression on the girl 's face , the exact position of her hands around the cup , the red back of the faceless man . <eos>
He 's been waiting for you . <eos>
He had wanted to take in the details of what he was seeing , but the task was somehow beyond him . <eos>
The apartment loomed up around him . <eos>
No more than a general impression – even though he was there , looking at those things . <eos>
He found himself sitting on a sofa , alone . <eos>
The act of moving from one place seemed to require all his attention , as though not to think of what he was doing would reduce him to immobility . <eos>
It seemed to Quinn that Stillman 's body had not been used for a long time and that all its functions had been relearned , so that motion had become a conscious process , each movement broken down into its component submovements , . <eos>
As the car rattled through the park , Quinn looked out the window and wondered if these were the same trees that Peter Stillman saw when he walked out into the air and the light . <eos>
Occasionally , after poring over an object , Stillman would toss it back onto the sidewalk . But more often than not he would open his bag and lay the object gently inside it . <eos>
Twice , when his scavenging haul had been unusually large , he returned to the hotel and remerged a few minutes later with an empty bag . <eos>
On most days he spent at least several hours in Riverside Park , walking methodically along the macadam footpaths or else thrashing through the bushes . <eos>

If this interpretation required knowledge on Stillman 's part , then Quinn would accept this knowledge as an article of faith , . <eos>
Quinn could walk through the streets every day , and still he would not find him . <eos>
Quinn backtracked in his mind . <eos>
For two weeks he had been tied by an invisible thread . <eos>
It was a well-kept place , with polished doorknobs and clean glass , and it had an air of bourgeois sobriety that appealed to Quinn . <eos>
Auster 's apartment was on the eleventh floor , and Quinn rang the buzzer , expecting to hear a voice speak to him . <eos>
Just as he opened his mouth to speak , he was interrupted by a clattering of keys , the sound of the door opening and then slamming shut , and a burst of voices . <eos>
A moment later he heard the child running towards him . The child shot into the living room , caught sight of Quinn , and stopped dead in his tracks . <eos>
He prayed to himself . <eos>
And around and around it goes , shouted the boy , suddenly spreading his arms and spinning around the room . <eos>
The Mets matched that run in their half of the inning . <eos>
And though he is not permitted to sit beside women unrelated to him or to look at them or to communicate with them ( all of which probably saves him a great deal of trouble ) , he seems a good-hearted young man and he is visibly enjoying himself . <eos>

Imagine him here – the very end of the world , a sea the color of lead , a sky the color of smoke , a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina – and going up this river . <eos>

We called at some more places with farcical names where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb <eos>
We called at some more places with farcical names , where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb ; all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf , as if Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders ; in and out of rivers , streams of death in life , whose banks were rotting into mud , whose waters , thickened into slime , invaded the contorted mangroves , that seemed to writhe at us . <eos>
A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times . <eos>
It turned aside for the bowlders , and also for an undersized railway-truck lying there on its back . <eos>

They had laid flag-stones under the walnut trees , so that it would n't be too damp . <eos>
Sometimes before the dusk wavered the wood away into the distance , he went out into the sunlight that collected like golden water and shot a partridge . <eos>

The doors opened ; voices from without came in on currents of air ; he emerged among the others taken in at all the senses , walking steadily across the tarmac through the raw-potato whiff of the undergrowth , the fresh , early warmth on hands , the cool metallic taste of last night 's storm at the back of the throat , <eos>
The doors opened ; voices from without came in on currents of air ; he emerged among the others into heady recognition taken in at all the senses , walking steadily across the tarmac , the fresh , early warmth on hands , the cool metallic taste of last night 's storm at the back of the throat , <eos>
He knew no one but the walk was processional , a reception to him , and by the time he entered the building over the steps where , as always , dead insects fallen from the light had not been swept away , it was all as suddenly familiar and ordinary as the faces other people were greeting were , to them . <eos>

A furry black band of ants led up a cupboard door . <eos>
He stood at the sink , drinking cold water and looking at the avocado pear pip growing suspended by three matchsticks in the neck of a pickle jar of water . <eos>
He heard Dando , forced by the old Labrador , walking about outside the guest hut and talking reproachfully to the dog ; <eos>
and then it was morning and Festus 's assistant was at the door . <eos>
There was a moment in the stadium when he heard it on the perimeter of the sky just as Kenyatta began to speak , and he and Vivien Bayley , the young wife of the registrar of the new university , sitting beside him , collided glances of alert apprehension ... <eos>

Bray surprised her by asking her to dance , swaying stiffly to a rhythm he did n't know , but nevertheless keeping the beat , so that they would n't make fools of themselves . <eos>

Someone called to Vivien and they were drawn away from the dancers . <eos>

Neil stood on the moonlit patch of earth and called up , but there was no response . <eos>
He answered Neil with a liberal use of Bwana , as a white man would expect if he were to do such a thing as stop for a black one , and when he got into the car beside Bray and the South African , sat among these black and white city people like a hedgehog rolled into itself at a touch . <eos>

Not for the first time , an argument had broken out over breakfast . <eos>
Mr Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning . <eos>
Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle . <eos>
All Harry 's spellbooks , his wand , robes , cauldron and top-of-the-range Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs the instant Harry had come home . <eos>
What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school ? <eos>
He 'd been talking of nothing else . <eos>
Now , we should aim to get in a few good compliments . <eos>
When dinner 's over , you take Mrs Mason back to the lounge , Petunia , and I 'll bring the subject round to drills . <eos>
Countless times , Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig 's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione , but it was n't worth the risk . <eos>
Harry had n't told the Dursleys this ; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them locking him in the cupboard under the stairs . <eos>
What would n't he give now for a message ? <eos>
Harry had slipped through Voldemort 's clutches , but it had been a narrow escape , and even now , weeks later , Harry kept waking in the night , drenched in cold sweat , wondering where Voldemort was now , remembering his livid face , his wide , mad eyes . <eos>
As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt , Aunt Petunia knew he had n't really done magic , but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head . <eos>
Harry crossed to his bedroom , slipped inside , closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed . <eos>
Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase . <eos>
Th-thank you , said Harry , edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair . <eos>
People goggled through the bars as he lay , starving and weak , on a bed of straw . <eos>
And someone was goggling through the bars : a freckle-faced , red-haired , long-nosed someone . <eos>
Grinning at Harry were Fred and George , Ron 's elder twin brothers . <eos>
When the bars were safely in the back seat Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry 's window . <eos>
Fred and George climbed carefully through the window . <eos>
Harry dashed around his room , collecting his things together and passing them out of the window . <eos>
At last , panting , they reached the landing , then carried the trunk through Harry 's room . <eos>
Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window . <eos>
The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat , grinning from ear . <eos>
George handed the hairpin to Ron and a moment later , Hedwig had soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them . <eos>
They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and Harry looked out for the first time . <eos>
Mrs Weasley came to a halt her hands on her hips , staring from one guilty face to the next . <eos>

Her kitchen had strings of onions and fat hams hanging in glorious torture . <eos>
She smoked her own kippers up the chimney , skewering them in pairs . <eos>
At that second the car was rocked on every side . <eos>
I saw their faces streaked with tears pressed in agony . <eos>
As I came through the back door she frisked me from head to foot , removed the disinfectant and gave me a pair of overalls to wear . <eos>
I persuaded my parents to let me go and stay with my grandmother . <eos>
And he would stare at me , trying to see happiness the way he could see a business opportunity . <eos>
Poor baby , passed from hand to hand . <eos>
She made me stand in the corner of the kitchen , while she wheezed and whirred something out of the coal-hole . <eos>

My grandmother got down a pair of kippers and broiled them for us . <eos>
He wanted to go with them but what right had he to sit in his cups when they would be going home to cheap rations and unpaid bills ? <eos>

She threw me in the back seat and flung herself in after me . <eos>
Behind them , a taxi-driver struggled up the steps . <eos>
The little boy had been asleep and through his dreams came a sleigh piled with furs and followed on foot . <eos>
She took me home , did n't put on any lights , took off her clothes and had me lie down beside her . <eos>
I enjoyed looking at her , this self on self , self as desirer and desired , had a frankness to it I had not been invited to discover . <eos>
There was nothing left in the room , she and me hypnotised by each other , unable to speak because of the wind . <eos>
I moved in black knight right angles but apart from a few appreciative businessmen there was no one who seemed interested in me . <eos>

Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week ? <eos>
In any event , this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate . <eos>
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission 's political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi , who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech . <eos>
Madam President , in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group . <eos>
As an Austrian , I still have a vivid memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months . <eos>
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU . <eos>
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards . <eos>
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool . <eos>
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it , which causes problems . <eos>
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so and rightly so . <eos>
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner . <eos>
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN , that is the European committee for standardisation . <eos>
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force on 1 January 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work . <eos>
In so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods . <eos>
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it . <eos>
A moment ago , Mr Vatanen spoke to us . <eos>
Mr President , it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue . <eos>
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport Regional Policy and Tourism . <eos>
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing . <eos>
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament , , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air . <eos>
In our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , in the best and most profitable way , . <eos>
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports today . <eos>
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US . <eos>
The implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , . <eos>
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 - 2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission 's offices . <eos>
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part - session . <eos>
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament . <eos>
Mr President , on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur . <eos>
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the Regulation as we and Mrs Mccarthy , as rapporteurs for the general Regulation , had asked . <eos>
Firstly , we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators , precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided . <eos>

In the pharmaceutical sector – which is particularly vulnerable to IP infringement – a stronger IP regime could increase FDI inflows from $ 1.5 billion this year to $ 8.3 billion in 2020 , with pharmaceutical R&D doubling to $ 1.3 billion . <eos>
LONDON – Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised his audience at a conference late last year by speculating that banking assets in London could grow to more than nine times Britain 's GDP . <eos>

This knee - jerk reaction presumes that China 's current slowdown is but a prelude to more growth disappointments to come – a presumption that reflects widespread and longstanding fears of a broad array of disaster scenarios , ranging from social unrest and environmental catastrophes . <eos>
China 's export - led growth miracle would not have started in the 1980 ' s . <eos>
China emerged from the late-1990 ' s Asian financial crisis , and I suspect the same will be true this time . <eos>
What is known so far is that childhood obesity has become an epidemic in many countries , . <eos>
Even in the best of times , it did not lead to an increase in living standards , and it eventually led to the crisis from which we are only now recovering . <eos>

The consequences of maternal malnutrition are far - reaching , including higher child - mortality rates , more birth defects , increased susceptibility to infection , and specific nutritional deficiencies that can lock a child into a vicious cycle of poor health early . <eos>
After all , if an adequately nourished mother provides critical health benefits to her offspring , women can be viewed as the custodians of future generations ' health . <eos>
But its potential for sustained growth is faltering , owing to the imminent decline of its working - age population – projected to fall by 25 % – and rising competition from China and other emerging economies . <eos>
From 1960 to 2010 , the share of adults with a secondary education soared from 20 % . <eos>
By boosting productivity , increasing returns on investment , and facilitating technological adaption and innovation , South Korea 's abundance of well - educated workers has served as the foundation . <eos>
According to OECD data , only 55 % of South Korean women aged 15 - 64 are in the labor force , compared to an average of 65 % . <eos>
As it stands , while the services sector accounts for more than 70 % of employment , its productivity - growth rate remains much lower than that of the manufacturing sector . <eos>

Was Schauble 's statement supposed to serve as a rallying cry ? <eos>
In 1760 the elder Balzac set off for Paris ; <eos>
Balzac 's mother , born Anne - Charlotte - Laure Sallambier , came from a family of haberdashers . <eos>
When the Balzac children returned home , they were kept at a frigid distance , which affected the author - to - be significantly . <eos>
Balzac worked these scenes from his boyhood - as he did many aspects of his life and the lives of those around him - . <eos>
In 1814 the Balzac family moved to Paris , and Honoré was sent to private tutors and schools . <eos>
Instead , in April 1819 he was allowed to live in the French capital - as English critic George Saintsbury describes it - , while the rest of the family moved to a house twenty miles [ 32 km ] outside Paris . <eos>

" Although he originally called it Etudes des Mœurs ( Study of Mores ) , it eventually became known as La Comédie Humaine , and he included in it all the fiction that he had published in his lifetime . <eos>
After the collapse of his businesses , Balzac traveled to Brittany and stayed with the De Pommereul family . <eos>
It established him as an author of note ( even if the surface owes a debt to Walter Scott ) and provided him with a name . <eos>
He is trapped by the Abbé Herrera Vautrin . <eos>
The conniving and wrangling over wills and inheritances reflect the expertise gained by the author . <eos>
He would often work for fifteen hours or more ; <eos>
he claimed to have once worked for 48 hours . <eos>
In Balzac Ewelina found a kindred spirit for her emotional and social desires , . <eos>
Competing with the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt , Balzac visited her in St. Petersburg and impressed himself on her heart . <eos>
On 14 March 1850 , with Balzac 's health in serious decline , they drove from her estate in Wierzchownia village of Verkhivnia and were married . <eos>
Saintsbury points out that " Cœlebs can not talk of marriage . <eos>
They arrived in the French capital . <eos>
He had been visited that day by Victor Hugo , who later served as pallbearer and eulogist . <eos>

William Shakespeare ( 26 April 1564 ( baptised ) – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer . <eos>
Between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London . <eos>
His early plays were mainly comedies and histories , genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry century . <eos>
Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy . <eos>
His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts . <eos>
Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered in 1553 , . <eos>
Grammar schools varied in quality , but grammar school curricula were largely similar , the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors . <eos>
Hamnet died of unknown causes and was buried 11 August 1596 . <eos>
After the birth of the twins , Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene . <eos>
Some 20 th - century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster . <eos>
Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s . <eos>
Some of Shakespeare 's plays were published in quarto editions . <eos>
Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays . <eos>
The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson 's Works names him on the cast lists . <eos>
The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson 's Volpone is taken by some scholars . <eos>
Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford . <eos>
He moved across the river to Southwark , the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there . <eos>
in an answer to the sharers ' petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 , the King 's Men ' placed men players ' there , ' which were Heminges , Condell , Shakespeare , etc. ' . <eos>
In a document dated 7 June 1609 in a lawsuit he brought in Stratford , Shakespeare is described as ' generosus nuper in curia domini Jacobi ' ( ' gentleman , recently at the Court of King James ' ) . <eos>
However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London . <eos>
After 1610 , Shakespeare wrote fewer plays , and none are attributed to him . <eos>
Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials . <eos>
Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others agree that Shakespeare did the same , mostly early and late in his career . <eos>
Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised by other writers . <eos>
The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI , written in the early 1590 s . <eos>
Shakespeare 's early classical and Italianate comedies , containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences , give way in the Mid-1590s . <eos>
Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life , but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day . <eos>
When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord , they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre , the first playhouse built by actors for actors , on the south bank of the Thames . <eos>

Although the performance records are patchy , the King 's Men performed seven of Shakespeare 's plays at court , including two performances of The Merchant of Venice . <eos>
After 1608 , they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre and the Globe during the summer . <eos>
The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing , . <eos>
He was replaced around the turn of the 16 th century . <eos>
A third narrative poem , A Lover 's Complaint , in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor , was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets . <eos>
Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed , but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career . <eos>
Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim , Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare 's " sugred Sonnets among his private friends " . <eos>
Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599 , Francis Meres had referred in 1598 . <eos>
The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self declaration of Vice . <eos>
It is often beautiful , but its sentences tend to start , pause , and finish at the end of lines , . <eos>
This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation , cutting and wide interpretation without loss . <eos>
Until Romeo and Juliet , for example , romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic . <eos>
The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology , in particular that of Hamlet , . <eos>
In 1598 , the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English writers . <eos>
but during the 18 th century , critics began to respond to Shakespeare what they termed his natural genius . <eos>
The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles . <eos>
The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by John Shakespeare , found in 1757 . <eos>
Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare 's Catholicism , but the truth may be impossible to prove either way . <eos>
